- Their is no flowid units like rem or em in React native
- You can define percentage unite and if the parent container dimensions are defined

flex-1 -> means it will accupie the full screen

width-25 -> setting the widthe of the screen(height-25)

width-40% -> it the parent continer width is specified then this will accupie the 40% of parent width
             (height-40%)

padding-
       padding 10 ( all around )
       paddingTop 10 ( only top ) ( rest of direction too )
       paddingHorizontal 10 ( 10 padding on horizental axis ( same for veritcal)

margin-
       same as the Padding

border-
        you have to apply every border seperately
     borderWidth:3
     borderColor:"red"
     borderRadius:3 //use only on view dont use in the text (radious on text does't work properly)

boxShadow-
        box shadow does't work in the both the plateform simiarly ( onlt work in ios and not in android)

        shadowColor:"#33333",
        shadowOffset:{
        width:6,
        height:4,
        },
        shadowOpacity:.3,
        shadowRadius:4,

        //to make it work on android you hav to set a elevation property on android(or use third party packages)
         elevation:10

Style Inheritance
        compare to style inheritance in css, in mobile doesn't work.
        ( eg parent text styles get inherited to the childs elements like font size, text color )

        In react native inheritance only work from Text parent to its child text parent
        not View to Text
