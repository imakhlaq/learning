Need to audit everything we do for the application
Create an auditable (abstract) class this class can be extended to create an
entity listener for any entity. Auditable --> all entities will inherit from this class. so
when every we try to save an entity in the database all of the logic inside of the auditable
will be executed and if we dont have who is updating the data or creating the daa then the execution
will fail. (Ongoing). We can get information from this class but we cant set information from this class.

```java
    private Long id; //This is going to serve all the subclasses so dont need to define an id from the subclasses.
private String referenceId = new AlternativeJdkIdGenerator().generateId().toString(); //Used to identity a specific resource in the database. Anytime we save an entity they get a refID
private Long createdBy; // WHO CREATED IT.
private Long updatedBy; //WHO UPDATED IT.
private LocalDateTime createdAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time
private LocalDateTime updatedAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time.
```

This are the fields needed for the super class so that all the subclasses can inherit from this
is also going to be an entity that jpa will manage for us, what we have to do now is add the annotation for the required
fields.

```java

@Id
@SequenceGenerator(name = "primary_key_seq", sequenceName = "primary_key_seq", allocationSize = 1)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "primary_key_seq")
@Column(name = "id", updatable = false)
private Long id; //This is going to serve all the subclasses so don't need to define an id from the subclasses.
private String referenceId = new AlternativeJdkIdGenerator().generateId().toString(); //Used to identity a specific resource in the database. Anytime we save an entity they get a refID

@NotNull
private Long createdBy; // WHO CREATED IT.

@NotNull
private Long updatedBy; //WHO UPDATED IT.

@NotNull
@Column(name = "created_at", nullable = false, updatable = false)
@CreatedDate
private LocalDateTime createdAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time

@Column(name = "updated_at", nullable = false)
@CreatedDate
private LocalDateTime updatedAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time.
```

**Quotes**
Explain each annotations and why you need them.

### Presist and PreUpdate [Refactoring Stopped here]

- What we need to do now is implement the logic for prepersit or preupdate so that before we presit
  for any entity we check for all of the field we are setting because we cant save anything in the database
  if we dont have who created it or who updated it or the date they were created or updated.

```java

@PrePersist
public void beforePersist() {

}
```

So this method is going to be called before any entity is saved in the database.

The beforePersist() method is used to set the createdAt, createdBy, updatedBy, and updatedAt
fields of an entity before it is persisted. It also checks if a userId is provide
and throws an exception if it is not.

The beforeUpdate() method is used to set the updatedAt and updatedBy fields of an entity before
it is updated. It also checks if a userId is provided and throws an exception if it is not.

So before we save any entity both of the above code is going to run.


---
The next time I want to work on is the exception handling

- ApiException

```java
public void beforePersist() {
    if (userId == null) {
        throw new ApiException("Cannot persist entity without user ID in Request  Context for this Thread ");
    }
```

So we will have to create a new class for exception handling.

```java
public class ApiException extends RuntimeException {
    public ApiException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
    public ApiException() {
        super("An error occurred");
    }
}
```

The objective of this ApiException class is to provide a custom exception class that can be used to handle exceptions
that occur during the execution of API-related operations in a Java application.
By extending the RuntimeException class, instances of ApiException do not need to be caught or declared explicitly.
This makes it easier to handle API-related exceptions throughout the codebase.

"Implementing request context and userId handling in domain package"

The next thing we will be working on next is figuring out what

```java
     var userId = 1L;
```

is going to look like, we need to have a way to always get, set and retreive the userId in the incoming
request context when the request comes in. We need to set it and then get it anytime adn anywhere
in the application.

- Request context
  The point is to access some information in every thread when the request comes in.
  So we are going to creat a thread local and its going to give us a way to create
  variables in every thread so we can access those variables when and where ever we want adn they are private fields.

Creat a domain class.
Domains are like classes we have in the application while enity is still classes but are things that
we are persisting in the database, we calling them entity because they are being managed by
JPA and JPA calls them entities.
Domains are just regular classes that are not being persisted in the database by JPA.

Stopped here today [thein3rovert @github](https://github.com/thein3rovert)
19/05/2024

Start the next day 21/05/2024
Working on the Domain Package and also the userId in the request context.

```java

@PreUpdate
public void beforeUpdate() {
    var userId = 1L;
    if (userId == null) {
        throw new ApiException("Cannot update entity without user ID in Request  Context for this Thread");
    }
}
```

[Entity: Auditable -> exception: ApiException -> domain: RequestContext]
Created the request context class -> domain package.

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<Long> USER_ID = new ThreadLocal<>(); // Allows us to create userId variables in every thread
// and also set and get the userid (its like a typeof the variables)
private RequestContext() {
}
//Setting the variable to nul
public static void start() {
    USER_ID.remove();
} //Allows us to initialise everything.
//SETTER AND GETTER FOR THE VARIABLES
public static void setUserId(Long userId) {
    USER_ID.set(userId);
}
public static Long getUserId() {
    return USER_ID.get();
}
```

Since all the values in the request context are all static we can just call the
request context then set and get the values from the request context.

The next thing we're going to do it make use of it inside the Auditable class, we are going to
be getting the values and later we are going to be setting them whereever the request comes in
as the values are going to be done in a filter so where the request comes in we are going
to have some filter to set the request, however we need to do some logic because depending
on the request we might not have a userId in every request for example when we are sending a
request to login or register.

```java

@PrePersist
public void beforePersist() {
    var userId = RequestContext.getUserId();
```

```java

@PreUpdate
public void beforeUpdate() {
    var userId = RequestContext.getUserId();
    ;
```

Now we have set the values of the userId which will be coming from the request context.
So before a user can persist an entity it has to have a userId and also
before a user can update an entity it has to have a userId and also every other classes
that we created are going tp inherit from the Auditable class that way all of the auditables
fields will also belong to that class and the presist and update will also be done in that class
before any other class is being saved or updated.

---
Next, Creating the user class which will inherit from the Auditable class.
[Entity: [Auditable, User] -> exception: ApiException -> domain: RequestContext]
This user class is going to represent the data(User) that will be stored(persisting) in the database.

- The first we going to be doing is extend auditable so once we do that the class inherit the
  fields from the auditable class that was previously created above.

```java
package com.in3rovert_so.securedoc.entity;

public class User extends Auditable {
}
```

We're also going to keep doing this for all entity that we are going to be creating thats is going
to be managed by JPA.

- Defining the fields so far we have

```java
 private String userId;
private String firstName;
private String lastName;
private String email;
private Integer loginAttempts;
private LocalDateTime lastLogin;
private String phone;
private String bio;
private String ImageUrl;
```

The `fields loginAttempts and lastLogin` are going to be used to keep track of the user login attempts and
the last time they logged in so it will be used to block them if they exceed a limit.

After that i added fields for Spring Security

```java
   private boolean accountNonExpired;
private boolean accountNonLocked;
private boolean enabled;
private boolean mfa; 
```

These fields helps to load the user from database and use some of the values to create
a user details that we can pass into spring security so that spring security can do auth for us.

We are also going to need to keep track of the secret QR code so we can determine if the code
the user entered (verification code) is correct or not and we also need to save this value in a database
and this value is going to be created every time set their multi factor authentication because thatas what
we're going to use to determine if its a correct code or not.

```java
private String QrCodeSecret;
```

---

- User Entity Part 2 (Adding Annotations)

```java
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@Builder //Need to know what this is for
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "users") //Naming the table
@JsonInclude(NON_DEFAULT)
```

I also enforce some of the fields to be not null and also the id to be unique.

```java

@Column(updatable = false, unique = true, nullable = false) // We cannot have a user without an id
private String userId;
```

```java

@Column(unique = true, nullable = false) //We cannot have a user without an email also
private String email;
```

Everytime we deserialize an object from the database we want to get the id from the
database, and send it over as a JSON to the client(backend)
When ever we get a deta from a database its called deserialization. When we send the
JSON to the client its called serialization.

> Serialization is converting an object to JSON and deserialization is converting JSON
> to an object and this is what JPA is doing.

```java

@JsonIgnore
private String qrCodeSecret;
```

The reason why we are doing this is because when ever we want to send the Json to the client
we dont want to send the QR code with the data.

```java

@Column(columnDefinition = "TEXT")  //Updating the column definition of the ImageURI because its a very long string.
private String qrCodeImageUrl;
```

We are updating the column definition of the ImageURI because its a very long string and
we want to save it in the database, having a very long string is not a good idea bacause this
will take up a lot of space in the database and it will slow down the application.

- User Roles
  The next things we need to do is adding roles to the user and also define a class that is going to be
  the class representing ther roles. Thats what we are going to be working onn next.
  I rename the user clasds to UserEntity because that is what we are going to be using
  to have a simple user class that is going to map some of the object fields into
  an other object. The userEntity is going to be the entity it is never going to go to the
  frontend but the user class is what we are going to be sending over to the frontend.

- Now lets create the RolesEntity
  [Entity: [Auditable, UserEntity, Roles] -> exception: ApiException -> domain: RequestContext]
    ```java
    public class RoleEntity extends Auditable{
    private String name;
    private String authorities; 

}

```
Because we are goign to define authorities for each roles and they will be ENUM.
```java
private String authorities;
```

And then we import that RoleEntity into the UserEntity class so that we can use it
to create the roles and then I did some mapping to

```java

@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(name = "user_roles",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id"))
private Set<RoleEntity> roles = new HashSet<>();
```

Many to one means many users can have one role and one role can have many users because the
roles they carry their permissions to do certain things. So depending your the roles that give
user a permission to do and not do certain things.
If i want a high level control i can just use the roles and if i want a refine grainnroles
i can use the permissions and authorities associated with that roles.

**_For examples:_**
> ROLE(read, update, delete):
> USER{read, update}
> ADMIN{read, update, delete}

Much better way, meaning the user can read, update and reah documnets.

> USER{user:read, user:update, document:read}
> ADMIN{user:read, user:update, user:delete}
> MANAGER{document:read, document:update, document:delete, user:update}
>
Back to the mapping

```java
  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
//Many user can only have one role,  the Eager means when ever we load a user, we want
//load their roles.
@JoinTable(
    name = "user_roles",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(
        name = "user_id", referencedColumnName = "id"
    )
)
```

The @JoinTable will create another table in btw to map the UserEntity with the RoleEntity in the database
so this table will have the name of user_roles so that we can clearly identity
this table. Then we say "From this Jointable class, i want the name of the column
to be user_id and the name of the referenced column to be id."
The "id" is going to be the id of the UserEntity which is going to be the foreign key.
Which is this id:

```java
 private Long id; 
```

Which is also the id of the RoleEntity.

```java
    private String userId;
```

And then the inverseJoinColumns is going to be the name of the column in the RoleEntity

```java
 @JoinTable(
    name = "user_roles",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(
        name = "user_id", referencedColumnName = "id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(
        name = "role_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
)
    )
private RoleEntity role;
```

We are joing both the UserEntity and the RoleEntity in the database. The first joinColumns is going to be
is referencing the UserEntity and the second joinColumns is going to be referencing the RoleEntity fields.
![joincolumn explain.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fjoincolumn%20explain.png)
![joincolumn table.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fjoincolumn%20table.png)

The next thing i want to do is define the enum to take care of the roles.

Date: 22/05/2024
TODO: Define the enum to take care of the roles and the table.
[entity: Auditable -> exception: ApiException -> domain: RequestContext -> enumeration: Authority]
So we created a new package called enumaration which has a class called Authority which is an "ENUM" class.

```java
public enum Authority {
}
```

Then went into the RoleEntity and change the authorities field and change the `private String authorities;`
to `private Authority authorities;`

```java
    private Authority authorities; // Because we are going  to need to define authorires for each roles and they will be ENUM.
}
```

So thats going to be the authoority for the user roles.
Now we are just going to define some enum in the authoriets class.

```java
  USER(""),
ADMIN(""),
SUPER_ADMIN(""),
MANAGER("");
```

These values are like string we need to have a way to get these strings, in other to o that we will
define some fields and constructors also a getter in other the get the values.

```java
   private final String value;
Authority(String value) {
    this.value = value;
}
public String getValue() {
    return this.value;
}
```

Now we will define the values what the values are going to be, in other to do that we created a constatnt
class. Inside this constasnt class we are going to be defining the values of all the authorities.

```java
public class Constants {
    public static final String ROLE_PREFIX = "ROLE_";
    public static final String AUTHORITY_DELIMITER = ",";
    public static final String USER_AUTHORITY = "document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
    public static final String ADMIN_AUTHORITY = "user:create,user:read,user:update,document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
    public static final String SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY = "user:create,user:read,user:update,user:delete,document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
    public static final String MANAGER_AUTHORITY = "document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";

}
```

First the ROLE_PREFIX is going to be the prefix of the role, More about it will be explained later.

- The AUTHORITY_DELIMITER is going to be the delimiter of the authorities, which is the litle comma ","
  dividing/separating the authorities..
- The USER_AUTHORITY is going to be the authority of the user.
- ADMIN_AUTHORITY is going to be the authority of the admin.
- SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY is going to be the authority of the super admin.
- MANAGER_AUTHORITY is going to be the authority of the manager.
  After that we copied the authorities of each user and pasted in the Authority class user field.

```java
public enum Authority {
    USER("USER_AUTHORITY"),
    ADMIN("ADMIN_AUTHORITY"),
    SUPER_ADMIN("SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY"), //These values are like string we need to have a way to get these strings.
    MANAGER("MANAGER_AUTHORITY");
```

What we have mto figure out now is mapping this value from some data coming from my database
because we need to map these values if we going to be working with data in the database, as of now we dont
have a way to remove these values from here and we are going to need to do that when ever we are mmapping things and
sending reposnse back to the frontend or to any http client that calls this server.

Next we going to see if we can define a converter for these values:

```java
public enum Authority {
    USER("USER_AUTHORITY"),
    ADMIN("ADMIN_AUTHORITY"),
    SUPER_ADMIN("SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY"), //These values are like string we need to have a way to get these strings.
    MANAGER("MANAGER_AUTHORITY");
```

Because we are going have a way to convert these values:

```java
 public static final String USER_AUTHORITY = "document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
public static final String ADMIN_AUTHORITY = "user:create,user:read,user:update,document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
public static final String SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY = "user:create,user:read,user:update,user:delete,document:create,document:read,document:update,document:delete";
public static final String MANAGER_AUTHORITY = "document:create,document:read,document:update
```

from the database to the java class or the enum and visa versal.
> [AI GENERATED
>
> Here, each authority (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, MANAGER) is assigned a corresponding value (USER_AUTHORITY,
> ADMIN_AUTHORITY, SUPER_ADMIN_AUTHORITY, MANAGER_AUTHORITY)

> vice versa.

---

- What we want to do now is to create a converter for these values.
  create package inside enum package, called the `converter`, this package has a java class
  called `RoleConverter`.

```java
public class RoleConverter implements AttributeConverter<Authority, String> {
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Authority authority) {
        return null;
    }
    @Override
    public Authority convertToEntityAttribute(String s) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Because we implemented the `AttributeConverter` interface, we need to implement the
AttributeConverter interface we need to add the convertToDatabaseColumn method and
the convertToEntityAttribute method this helps us to convert these values from the database to the java class or the
enum and visa versal.

- convertToDatabaseColumn: convertToDatabaseColumn, is an implementation of the AttributeConverter interface's
  convertToDatabaseColumn method.
  It's used in the context of JPA (Java Persistence API) to convert an Authority object into a string representation
  that can be stored in a database column

- convertToEntityAttribute:This will take whatever values we give it or get from the database and convert them to
  the enum and convert ut to entityAttribute.

```java

@Override
public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Authority authority) {
    if (authority == null) {
        return null;
    }
    return authority.getValue();
}
```

- convertToEntityAttribute, is an implementation of the AttributeConverter interface's convertToEntityAttribute method.
  It takes a String parameter code and returns an Authority enum value.

```java

@Override
public Authority convertToEntityAttribute(String code) {
    if (code == null) {
        return null;
    }
    return Stream.of(Authority.values())
        .filter(authority -> authority.getValue().equals(code))
        .findFirst()
        .orElseThrow(IllegalArgumentException::new);
}
```

The method checks if the code is null. If it is, it returns null. If not, it uses Java 8's Stream API to find the first
Authority enum value whose value field matches the code string. If no match is found, it throws an IllegalAccessError.
In essence, it's a utility method to convert a string value into the corresponding Authority enum value.

Now we need to define some annotations for the converter.

```java
@Converter(autoApply = true)
```

This just means that the converter will automatically run the converter when ever we are loading the class from the
database.
So when ever we are going to convert the Authority to enum to the database, we are going to
get the string value.

```java

@Override
public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Authority authority) {
    if (authority == null) {
        return null;
    }
    return authority.getValue();
}
```

Thats what we are going to save and then since we save string values in the database, we are just going to map
them back to the authority where the values match.

```java
public Authority convertToEntityAttribute(String code) {
    if (code == null) {
        return null;
    }
    return Stream.of(Authority.values())
        .filter(authority -> authority.getValue().equals(code))
        .findFirst()
        .orElseThrow(IllegalArgumentException::new);
}
```

---

#### Password

Now if we go back to the UserEntity fields we are missing a field for the `Password` adn if we dont have
a password then we cant really save a user and if we cant save a user they wont be able to login. The reason for
this is going to be that the password is going to be its own class. Its going to be a stand alone class and
we are going to work out it's logic.

First we created a credential class for handling the credentials of the user in the class we have these fields.

```java
public class CredentialEntity extends Auditable {
    private String password;
    private UserEntity userEntity;
```

Then we define a construtor for the fields.

```java
public CredentialEntity(String password, UserEntity userEntity) {
    this.password = password;
    this.userEntity = userEntity;
}
```

Annotations

```java
public class CredentialEntity extends Auditable {
    private String password;
    @OneToOne(targetEntity = UserEntity.class, fetch = EAGER) //When ever we load the userEntity it will load
    //all user associated with the credentials.
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id", nullable = false) //We need the id specifically so we its just going tom
    //get the user_id from the userEntity.
    @OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)
    @JsonIdentityInfo(generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property = "id")
    @JsonIdentityReference(alwaysAsId = true)
    @JsonProperty("user_id")
    private UserEntity userEntity;
```

@OneToOne: This annotation indicates that the relationship is a one-to-one relationship.
@JoinColumn: This annotation specifies the name of the column in the database that will be used to join this entity with
the UserEntity entity.
@OnDelete: This annotation specifies the action to be taken when the referenced UserEntity is deleted. In this case, it
is set to CASCADE, meaning that the referenced UserEntity will be deleted along with this entity.
@JsonIdentityInfo: This annotation is used for JSON serialization and deserialization. It specifies the generator and
property for the identity of this entity.
@JsonIdentityReference: This annotation specifies that the user_id property should always be serialized as an ID
reference.
Now these credeintials is associated with the userEntity so aytime we are going to save a new
credntial we need to give it a user.

Below is a better illustation of how this works.
![credential.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fcredential.png)

So now we can represent this whole class as the credentials for the user.
---

- The next thing we going to do is the confirmation, because whenever someone creates a new
  account we need to create some kindof a token or a key to confirm that the user is who they say they are.
  and then we are going to save it in the database and send them an email with the key and password and we need to
  manage them
  in the database. Thats what we going to be working on next.

#### Confirmation Entity

This is pretty similar to the credentials entity, in this class

```java
public class ConfirmationEntity extends Auditable {
    private String key; // ? This is going to be a like a UUID that we will sent to the user as a token
```

We have a field for the key, this key is going yto be a UUID that will be sent to the user,
when they sign up

```java
 public ConfirmationEntity(UserEntity userEntity) { // We dont need to get the key because they are going to generate it for us.
    this.userEntity = userEntity;
    this.key = UUID.randomUUID().toString(); //When ever we create a new instance of this confirmation, it going to
    //automaticallt generate the key. 
}
```

The UUID is what will be saved in the database as the id for the confirmation.

#### Email Services

When ever someone creates a new user we will send them an email to confirm their account otherwise
they wont be able to login. That means we need to have an email service so we can send an email
to the user when ever we create a new account for them with a link so when they click on it
they can activate their account.

We created a new emial services package. In this package we habe a `sendNewAccountEmail` method and
`sendPasswordResetEmail` method.

```java
 void sendNewAccountEmail(String name, String to, String token);
void sendPasswordResetEmail(String name, String to, String token);
```

And they have the same parameter, the name of the user, the email of the user, and the token. In other
to create the implemetation for these methods we will need to create a package for the implemetation..
Then we created an `EmailServiceImpl` class which will have a Bean because we want to inject it
to all the classes in the application.

```java
public class EmailServiceImpl implements EmailService {
    private final JavaMailSender mailSender;
    @Override
    public void sendPasswordResetEmail(String name, String to, String token) {
    }
    @Override
    public void sendNewAccountEmail(String name, String to, String token) {
    }
}
```

In other to make it a bean we added

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
```

We dont have a JavaMailSender so we need to ad the `JavaMailSender` dependency to the Pom.xml and this dependency
is coming from the `spring-boot-starter-mail` library.
Inside the Pom.xml we need to add the following dependency

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-mail</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After i added two more fields

```java
public class EmailServiceImpl implements EmailService {
    @Value("${spring.mail.verify.host}")
    private String host;
    private String fromEmail;
```

The host is used do identify what my enviroment is when i am generating the link for the email because
i dont want to use localhost or static ip-address, i need these to come from a properties file or something
similar. Added the @value annotation to the `host` field because we are going to use it in the email service
to get the host from the properties file.

```java
  public void sendNewAccountEmail(String name, String email, String token) {
    try {
        SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
        message.setSubject("NEW_USER_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION");
        message.setFrom(fromEmail);
        message.setTo(email);
        message.setText(getEmailMessage(name, host, token));
        sender.send(message);
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        log.error(exception.getMessage());
        throw new ApiException("Unable to send email");
    }
}
```

The method takes three parameters: name (a string representing the name of the user), email (a string representing the
email address of the user), and token (a string representing the password reset token).
Inside the method, a SimpleMailMessage object is created to represent an email message. The subject of the email is set
to "NEW_USER_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION". The sender's email address is set to the value of fromEmail, and the recipient's
email address is set to the value of email. The email message text is set by calling a method called getEmailMessage
with the name, host, and token parameters.
Finally, the send method of the sender object is called to send the email message. If any exception occurs during the
process, the exception message is logged, and an ApiException is thrown with the message "Unable to send email".

Similar thing is done for the sendResetPasswordEmail method. Inside the two method we have new method called the
getEmailMessage and the getResetPasswordMessage, this method is going to be used in the two methods above
to create the email message text and the reset password message text.

SO the next thing we have to do is make sure that both these methods are asynchronous because
we dont want to wait for the email to be sent to the user.

```java

@Async
public void sendNewAccountEmail(String name, String email, String token) {
```

```java

@Async
public void sendPasswordResetEmail(String name, String email, String token) {
```

What these it going to do is run all these method in a separate thread when ever we call it so we dont
have to wait for one to finsh the execution of the thread continue.

The next thing we have to do is make sure that we can define the `getEmailMessage and the getResetPasswordMessage`
method they are going to be a Util method.

Stopped here today [thein3rovert @github](https://github.com/thein3rovert)

Date: 23/05/2024
TODO: Working on Email services method (Email Utils)
First we create a new package for the util methods, then we create a new class called EmailUtils.

```java
   public static String getEmailMessage(String name, String host, String token) {
    return "Hello" + name + ",\n\nYour new account has been created. Please click on the link below to verify your account.\n\n" +
        getVerificationUrl(host, token) + "\n\nThe Support Team";
}
```

Its taking the name the age and the token and its concatenating all so that it can give us a string.
The method takes three parameters:name (a string representing the name of the user), host (a string representing the
host of the user), and token (a string representing the password verification token).
We also have the getVerification method which is responsible for geting the verification from
an endpoint.

```java
    private static String getVerificationUrl(String host, String token) {
    return host + "/verify/account?token=" + token;
}
```

We are going to also be creating the endpoint in our controller but later when we have the react application
we are going to have to pass in the react application base as the host because they have to go to
the frontend for some loading animations.
We also do similar thing to the other method `getResetPasswordMessage` because they both have the same, parameters.
so i only changed the method name.

- The next thing we wnat to do is create a way to call this method so we can send different email to the user,
  in other to do this we will need to use something called the eventlistener like an `event in spring` so that when
  someone create
  a new account we will just fire the event and send the email to the user.
  And thats what i am going to be working on for today.
  So inside the Enumeration package, a new class was created called the EmailService`EventType`  this helps us
  to identify the different type of events and we are going to have just two events.

```java
public enum EventType {
    REGISTRATION, RESETPASSWORD
}
```

for now these two event should be enabled.

```java
public class UserEvent {
    private UserEntity user;
    private EventType type;
    private Map<?, ?> data;//
}
```

When ever we fire an event we can optionally map in some data. If we dont have any data we don't have to pass in
anything. But anytime we fire a new user event we have to give
the user the type and any data associated with that event. Now that we have the event we have to create
the evenlistener.
So we created a package called `event` inside this package we have the UserEvent class that we created earlier.
which is responsible for creating the event. Inside the same package we created a new package called the `listener`
which containers the `UserEventListener` class.
The `UserEventListener` class is responsible for handle UserEvent events and perform actions based on the type of
the event. In this case, it sends emails to users based on the type of the event(Registation or ResetPassword).

```java
    public void onUserEvent(UserEvent event) {
    switch (event.getType()) {
        case REGISTRATION ->
            emailService.sendNewAccountEmail(event.getUser().getFirstName(), event.getUser().getEmail(), (String) event.getData().get("key"));
        case RESETPASSWORD ->
            emailService.sendPasswordResetEmail(event.getUser().getFirstName(), event.getUser().getEmail(), (String) event.getData().get("key"));
        default -> {
        }
    }
}
```

The onUserEvent method is the main method of this class. It takes a UserEvent object as a parameter and performs
different actions based on the type of the event.
It uses a switch statement to determine the appropriate method to call on the emailService object. For a REGISTRATION
event, it calls sendNewAccountEmail with the
user's first name, email, and a key from the event's data. For a RESETPASSWORD event, it calls sendPasswordResetEmail
with the same information.

Thats all for the EventListners also the @EventListener annotation is used to listen for events which
helps us to fire an event.

#### Database Config

What we need to do now is pass in some configurations for the Database, because when ever we run this
application we need to passin some information to the database such as the entity so we are going to need
to have some JPA configuration so that spring knows what it will look for in our configuaration so that it will
create the data source for us otherwise all these classes are going to fail so we need to pass in the database
configuration
for that.

So the next thing we need to do is work on the configuaration for our datasource.

---
So I am going to be using postgresql as the database so all of our data are going to be saved using in this relational
database system and i am going to be using pgaddmin to give me a UI interface so that i can work interact with the SQL
server.
Install Postgress, Pgadmin and PostMan for testing the API make sure to have these things on your computer, however in
these
project i am ging to be using docker so that I dont have to download things on my computer and also get
experience working with docker because i want to build my skills with docker and also use docker to get
an instance of PGadmin.

1. The first thing i want to do is create a compose file that is going to get me both postgresql and pgadmin running so
   that
   i can run the docker container.

```bash
code compose.yml
```

The First thing we have to do is define the services [List of services]

```yaml
services:
  services:
    postgresdb: # Define the postgresdb service
      container_name: postgrescontainer  # Set the name of the container to postgrescontainer
      image: postgres:latest #Need to change the version
      restart: always # always what docker to run on machine start
      environment: # Passing in some env variable becuse we want to pass in some default username,pasword and DB
        POSTGRES_USER: thein3rovert ${POSTGRES_USER} # For security so that we dont pass in plain text
        POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      expose:
        - 5432 # Expose from inside of the container
      ports:
        - 5432:5432 # Map the port to the machine port
      volumes:
        - postgresvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Mount a values for when container destroyed we run a new container witht the same value
        - ./schema.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.dl/schema.sql
```

> Never use latest when you are building a project you are going to run on other computer unless
> you are building your own project. Becuase latest is going to be out of date and this will cause
> issues with project especially is your not maintaining the peoject it is a bad idea to use latest.
> But if you are maintaining it, you can use latest.

2. The next is the Pgadmin service

```yml
gadmin:
  container_name: pgadmincontainer
  image: dpagel/pgadmin4:latest
  restart: always
  environment:
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: thein3rovert ${PGADMIN_EMAIL}
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${PGADMIN_PASSWORD}
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_ADDRESS: 6000
    PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: 6000
  expose:
    - 6000
  ports:
    - 7000:6000 #Mapping the 6000 to my local host 7000
  volumes:
    - postgresvolume:/var/lib/pgadmin
```

So we have an instance of Postgres and Pgadmin with appropriate configurations.

Stopped: 23/05/2024

---
Next thing we going to be working on is the .env file.

What we are going to be working on next is defining the enviroments variables for the our progres enviroments.
So i basically created a .env file and then define the values to the environment variables so that docker will
be able to use them, by be default docker is going to look for those file so we dont need to pass in any arguemene.
We now have our dockerfile and `.env` file, the next thing we want to do now is run the docker container in terminal.

## Running the docker compose file

To run the docker container

```bash
docker compose -f ./compose.yml up -d
```

Make sure to cross check the config file before running to mitigate any error, after wait for docker to pull the images.
![Screenshot 2024-05-28 203031.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FScreenshot%202024-05-28%20203031.png)
To check the port docker is running on

```bash
docker ps | grep post 
```

on windows powershell which is what i am using

```bash 
docker ps | Out-String | findstr /i "post"
```

These shows us the port of both postgres amd pgadmin, so the next thing we want to do is:

```bash 
hostname -I 
```

These shows us the internal ip-address so we can access it, how ever for window powershell,

```bash
ipconfig
```

After look for the IPV4 address and enter it in your browser with the config open post
for pgadmin.

```http request
http://192.168.0.10:7000/login?next=/
```

Doing that will get an instance of pgadmin running in your browser.

So what we need to donow is connect to the posgres database that we defined.
So i try to connect to my postgres instance with pgadmin but it seem to be ignoring my passoword
and possible my username which i added already to my config file so what do i need to do.
I think i will have to delete both images and pull them again with the config file.
So that why i will be working on next.

Today I have been able to make both the docker container and the pgadmin running. I am happy i was able to do it.
Now we will be able able be use the credentials to login without having to install them on our local machine.
After we run the application with thses credentials we will go back to the pgadmin and our tables should show up
on our database.
So what we are going to be working on next is putting the config file into our appllication.

## Application Properties.

Now we will be working on the database configuration to this application so that when we run it JPA will
pick up all of our entities and find the config file and use it to create the tables in our database.
So we created a new Directory called `docker` and then we move both our `compose.yml` and our `.env` file into the
`docker` directory.
If we dont want to use the enviroment variables we can add the hard coded values instead.

```yml
services:
  postgresdb:
    container_name: postgrescontainer
    image: postgres:16.3
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    expose:
      - 5432
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - postgresvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./schema.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.dl/schema.sql

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmincontainer
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: ${PGADMIN_EMAIL}
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${PGADMIN_PASSWORD}
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_ADDRESS: 6000
      PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: 6000
    expose:
      - 6000
    ports:
      - 8000:6000
    volumes:
      - pgadminvolume:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  postgresvolume:
  pgadminvolume:
```

- Now the first thing we are going to do it remain the proeprties file to yml file because i like working
  with yml alot. i like the syntax of a yml file.

Its important to define which profile is actieve when ever you have a springboot application becuase you can have dif
config.

- The we define some serilaization with Jaskson, jackson is mostly use for serialization.

- After we are going to define some data source properties.

```YML
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:postgresql://${POSTGRESQL_HOST}:${POSTGRESQL_PORT}/${POSTGRESQL_DATABASE}
      username: ${POSTGRESQL_USERNAME}
      password: ${POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD}
```

- After we are going to pass in some JPA data.

```yml
    jpa:
      open-in-view: false
      database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLInnoDBDialect
      generate-ddl: true
      show-sql: true
      hibernate:
        ddl-auto: update
      properties:
        hibernate:
          globally_quoted_identifiers: true
          dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
          format_sql: true
```

- jpa:open-in-view: false: This setting disables the "Open Session in View" pattern, which can be a performance issue in
  certain scenarios.
- jpa:database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLInnoDBDialect: This sets the database dialect to PostgreSQL
  with InnoDB storage engine.
- jpa:generate-ddl: true: This setting enables automatic generation of database schema based on the JPA entities.
- jpa:show-sql: true: This setting enables logging of SQL statements to the console.
- jpa:hibernate:ddl-auto: update: This setting tells Hibernate to update the schema automatically when the application
  starts.
  Thats all for the configuration file, what we are going to now is create a new directory named `data`
  inside this directory we will define the data(data.sql and schema.sql) spring is going look for a data sql
  and a schema sql it will run the schema first then run the data.

Inside these schema is where we create and define data such as tables and stuff and then in the data.sql
thats where we do the data insertion like inserting into a table and all. By default spring is going yo use
these two file and to be more organise we put them under the data directory., However spring will not be able to find
them if we do not specify the where to find them.
SO we are going to add another configuaration to the properties file in other to tell spring where to find
them.

```yaml
    sql:
      init:
        mode: never
        continue-on-error: false
        schema-locations: classpath:/data/schema.sql
        data-locations: classpath:/data/data.sql
```

The mode is set to never because we dont want to runt he application yet we have define the schema yet.
We also specify the classpath because we are going to use the data and schema files in our application.

Also because we are going to be uploading file we need to define some servlet and tell the servelt we are going
to be uploading a certain file size.

```yaml
    servlet:
      multipart:
        enabled: true
        max-file-size: 1000MB
        max-request-size: 1000MB
```

By default the servlet max file size is 1mb, however we are going to be uploading more then 1mb file
size.

Also Under Spring again we are goig to pass in some `mail` properties because we are going to be using
to verfiy our users.

```yaml
    mail:
      host: ${EMAIL_HOST}
      port: ${EMAIL_PORT}
      username: ${EMAIL_ID}
      password: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
      default-encoding: UTF-8
      properties:
        mail:
          mime:
            charset: UTF
          smtp:
            writetimeout: 10000
            connectiontimeout: 10000
            timeout: 10000
            auth: true
            starttls:
              enable: true
              required: true
      verify:
        host: ${VERIFY_EMAIL_HOST}
```

Because we are going to be using docker when we ever we are doing deployment so we have to define the port, so we are
going to add a server properties.

1. spring.profiles.active: This property specifies the active profile for your application. The default profile is set
   to dev, but it can be overridden by setting the ACTIVE_PROFILE environment variable.
2. spring.jackson: This section configures the Jackson JSON library. It sets the default property inclusion to non_null,
   and it configures various serialization and deserialization options.
3. spring.datasource: This section configures the data source for your application. It specifies the JDBC URL, username,
   and password for connecting to the PostgreSQL database. The values for these properties are set using environment
   variables.
4. spring.jpa: This section configures the JPA (Java Persistence API) properties for your application. It sets various
   options such as open-in-view, database-platform, generate-ddl, show-sql, and hibernate.ddl-auto.
5. spring.sql: This section configures the SQL initialization for your application. It specifies the mode,
   continue-on-error flag, and the locations of the schema and data SQL files.
6. spring.servlet.multipart: This section configures the multipart support for file uploads in your application. It sets
   the maximum file and request sizes.

So what we going to be working on next is definig the values for these properties.

```yaml
ACTIVE_PROFILE
POSTGRESQL_HOST
POSTGRESQL_PORT
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
EMAIL_HOST
EMAIL_PORT
EMAIL_ID
EMAIL_PASSWORD
VERIFY_EMAIL_HOST
```

## Creating the Tables with Spring JPA

After defining these values above the values was defined in a application-dev.yml file and also in
application-prod.yml. This was done to make it easier for us to deploy our application to both dev and prod.
Having it on dev means we can run the application on dev by default and then run on prod when we deploy the application.

After then i run the application and encounter some errors:

1. Initially i on commented the postgres dependencies so the error was a datasource error, meaning it
   could not find the data source for the database.
2. This error is Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "users" does not exist
   Meaning the application was not able to find the user table in the database.
   So what i am going to be working on now is basically finding the "Users does not exist error".

However the application did run after we uncommented the postgres dependencies and then the following tables
were created in the database.
[User-roles. roles, credentials and confirmations]

## Fixing the "Users does not exist error"

So the application is unhappy with this:

```java
    @Column(columnDefinition = "TEXT") //(userEntity)
```

It wanted us to put it to lowercase

```java
    @Column(columnDefinition = "text")
```

After that, the applicaition is now running and all the tables have been created also the
primary-key-seq that we created also exist in the database.
![postgresDB tables.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FpostgresDBTables.png)

Tables ERD
![ERD.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FERD.png).

WHhat we will be working on next is creating a controller then accessing the services and sending the
information to save the users.

---

## Creating repositories

In other to create any user we need to intaract with the database and in other for us to do that we will create the
`repo`,
We will create this repo for all of our entities.

We create the RoleRepository and it has an

```java
Optional<RoleEntity> findByName(String name);
```

For this repository, this is the only method we are going to have in here, we need to be able to featch a role
entity by just passing in the method.
Then we created tge UserRepository which also have a method to `getCredentialsEntitiesById` this helps us
get the credentials entity by passing in the user id which belongs to the UserEntity.

```java
  Optional<CredentialEntity> getCredentialEntitiesById(Long userId);
```

Then we also created a `ConfirmationRepository` which has a method to `findByKey` this helps us to find
a user by passing the Key and also we have another method `findByUserEntity` this helps us to find a user.

```java
public interface ConfirmationRepository extends JpaRepository<ConfirmationEntity, Long> {
    Optional<ConfirmationEntity> findByKey(String key);

    Optional<ConfirmationEntity> findByUserEntity(UserEntity userEntity);
}
```

Then we also have the `UserRepository` which has a method to `findByEmail` this helps us to find a user by
and also another method `fingUserByUserId` this helps us to find a user by passing in the user id.

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<UserEntity, Long> {
    Optional<UserEntity> findByEmailIgnoreCase(String email);

    Optional<UserEntity> findUserByUserId(String userId);
}

```

Now that we have created ann 4 needed repo we are good to intaract with the database. What we will do next now
is create the services and then we can call this repositories to get the information we need to create the
functionalties that we want so that we can save the user.

## Creating the UserServices

We created a UserServices interface class which has a method createUser that takes in a firstname, lastname, email
adn password as a parameter.
Because its an interface class, also created a UserServiceImpl class which serves as the implementation class for the
UserService interface class.

```java
public interface UserService {
    void createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password);
}

```

The `UserServiceImpl` implements the userservice and then has a method created user which is overriding the same method
created in its interface class.

```java

@Override
public void createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password) {

}
```

We imported the neccssary repo as fields needed for this class

```java
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
private final RoleRepository roleRepository;
private final CredentialRepository credentialRepository;
private final ConfirmationRepository confirmationRepository;
private final BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder;
```

The private final `BCryptPasswordEncoder` fields is a from spring security, how ever initially i commented
the dependency because we dont need it currently and i am just going to comment the field also because its not
needed currently.
We are just goigng to save the raw password for now.
Lastly we inport the`ApplicationEventPublisher` because we need to publish an event when a user is created.

CreateUser

```java
    public void createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password) {
    userRepository.save(createNewUser(firstName, lastName, email));
}
```

The method createUser takes in the parameter values, stores them in a userEntity then gets the password from the
credentialEntity and saves it along side the password after that it verifies the userEntity through the
ConfirmationEntity
and then created a publicEvent that helps to public an event to inform the other part of the system about the new user
registration.

```java

@Override
public void createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password) {
    var userEntity = userRepository.save(createNewUser(firstName, lastName, email));
    var credentialEntity = new CredentialEntity(userEntity, password);
    credentialRepository.save(credentialEntity);
    var confirmationEntity = new ConfirmationEntity(userEntity);
    confirmationRepository.save(confirmationEntity);
    publisher.publishEvent(new UserEvent(userEntity, EventType.REGISTRATION, Map.of("Key", confirmationEntity.getKey())));
}
```

1. Creating a User Entity: Storing basic user information like name and email.
2. Storing Credentials Securely: Saving hashed passwords for secure authentication.
3. Account Verification (Optional): Implementing a system for verifying new user accounts (potentially using a
   confirmation entity).
4. Event Notification (Optional): Publishing an event to inform other parts of the system about the new user
   registration.

So the new thing i am going to be created is the `createnewUser` helper method, this method takes
in the parameters firstname, lastname, email then gets the rolename from the Authority "User" after it then
returns a createUserEntity method that takes in the firstname, lastname, email and role.

```java
    private UserEntity createNewUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email) {
    var role = getRoleName(Authority.USER.name());
    return createUserEntity(firstName, lastName, email, role);
}
```

The `getRoleName` method howeever, takes in the name as param then calls the roleRepository method
`findByNameIgnoreCase` and pass in the name param, this helps to get the role from the database through
the roleRepository.

```java

@Override
public RoleEntity getRoleName(String name) {
    var role = roleRepository.findByNameIgnoreCase(name);
    return role.orElseThrow(() -> new ApiException("Role is not found"));
}
```

So when ever we wabt to create a user we are going to see if we can find the user role so by default we
are going to give user the user role so that mean is that this role should already be in the database, so what we are
going
to do now is we need to something called "seed" "database seeding". Database seeding is the process of
adding data to the database for the first time before the application is running. so we will porpulate the
database with some data

If we try to run the aplication now before it database seeding it will fail this is becasue
the database seeding hasnt happend and it wont be able to find a role in the database to assign
to the created User by Default.

So now we nee to work on the `createUserEntity` method:

```java
return createUserEntity(firstName, lastName, email, role); //Todo: Create the method
```

So in other to do this we head over to the utils package and then created a Userutils class in this class
we created a the default user that will will be saving in the database using the builder method and then
import the method in the userServiceImpl.createNewUser method.
So we can create a user now based on service perspective what we need to do now is create a controller to
or a restcontroller thats going to allow us to expose these funtionalities over HTTP server.

## Create a new Resource (Controller) for User

---
Created a new package called resource, this is the package for the controllers.

## UserResources

This class is a controller class responsible for exposing the functionalities over HTTP server.

```java
  public ResponseEntity<Response> saveUser(@RequestBody @Valid UserRequest user, HttpServletRequest request) {

}
```

The reason why we using the response is becuase we want to be able to always return the same
response with the same format throughout the entire application. Whether its a success response or a
failure response we what they to follow the same format.

##### Response

After then we created the response class which is a `Java record class`
The objective of the Response class is to encapsulate the response data from an API endpoint
in a standardized and structured way. It provides a way to represent the response in a format
that is easy to understand and manipulate

```java

@JsonInclude(NON_DEFAULT)
public record Response(String time, int code, String path, HttpStatus status, String message, String exception,
                       Map<?, ?> data) {

}
```

##### DTOrequest

The UserRequest class represents a data transfer object (DTO) that
is used to encapsulate the data sent in a user request. It contains several fields
representing the user's first name, last name, email, password, bio, and phone number.

The @NotEmpty annotations are used to validate that the fields are not empty or null
when the UserRequest object is created.

```java

@NotEmpty(message = "First name cannot be empty or null")
private String firstName;
```

The @Email annotation is used to validate that
the email field contains a valid email address.

```java

@NotEmpty(message = "Email cannot be empty or null")
@Email(message = "Invalid email address")
private String email
```

After creating the two class `Response` and `UserRequest dto` we then head back back to the
UserResource and import the class in the register endpoint.

```java

@PostMapping("/register")
public ResponseEntity<Response> saveUser(@RequestBody @Valid UserRequest user, HttpServletRequest request) {
    userService.createUser(user.getFirstName(), user.getLastName(), user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());

    return ResponseEntity.created(getUri()).body(getResponse(request, emptyMap(), "Account created. Check your email to enable your account", CREATED));
}
```

The @PostMapping("/register") annotation is used to map the HTTP POST method to the "/register" endpoint.

The saveUser method is the handler for this endpoint. It takes in a UserRequest object as a request body, which is
validated using the @Valid annotation. The HttpServletRequest object is used to get information about the HTTP request.

Inside the method, the userService.createUser method is called to create a new user with the provided first name, last
name, email, and password.

Finally, a ResponseEntity is returned with a Response object as the response body. The ResponseEntity.created method is
used to set the status code to 201 (CREATED) and the location header to the URI returned by the getUri method. The
getResponse method is used to create the Response object with the provided request, empty map, message, and status code

##### getURL

The next thing we are going to be working on now is the `getUri` method and the will be in the
utils package because its a helper method.
This is one of the most important util in the application, this class is where we going to do everyrthing to make
sure that we are always returning the same response all the time or everytime.

The RequestUtils class contains a static method getResponse which is used to create a Response object. This object
contains information about the request, such as the current date and time, the request URI, the HTTP status, a message,
and the data.

The next time we wnat to do now is we need to be able to create some roles in the database so that when ever we create
new user
the user will get a default role.

---
Date: 04/06/2024

So far we tested the application, we created a new user entity, however the user account is curretly locked
because when we created the user we sent a verification email to the user gmail and the user account gets inserted into
the
database along side the user data but the user then need to verfify the emial before the account gets unlocked.

So i had a few issue with the emial services where the service was unable to send the emial to the user, this took me a
while to
solve but this was due to the cinfiguration of the smtp email service and i was able to fix it.

After that the email service was able to send the emial to the user, what I am going to do now is to
verify the user account.

### User Account Verification

User need to be able to click on the link send to them and then comfirm the account, i am going to have
to create a filter that is going to filter all the event in case the user is registering or resetting password, if the
request is coming from a login user or if its a request that doesnt require a user then it will be ignored..

First we need to be able to activate our account so we are going to create another end points do that we can confirem
the new
coount. After that I willl then work on the filter so thbat i can set the userId automatically by using spring filter.
And
that is going to take me into spring security and other stuffs.

So I create a new Api endpoint called `VerifyUser` handles a GET request to "/verify/account"
It expects a query parameter named "token" in the request. The method calls the verifyAccountKey method of the
userService object,
passing in the value of the "token" query parameter. If the verification is successful, it returns a ResponseEntity
object with a 200 O
K status and a response body containing a message indicating that the account has been verified.

```java

@GetMapping("/verify/account")
public ResponseEntity<Response> verifyUser(@RequestParam("token") String key, HttpServletRequest request) {
    userService.verifyAccountKey(key);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, emptyMap(), "Account Verified. ", OK));
}
```

The `verifyAccountKey` method overrides a method named verifyAccountKey in an interface or superclass.
It takes a String parameter named key. This method is likely used to verify a user's account by setting the enabled
property of the
corresponding userEntity object to true and deleting the corresponding confirmationEntity object.

It takes the key and then get the confirmationEntity for that key and then get the user from that
confirmation and set the enabled property of the user to true, then the user repository save the user becuase we changed
the enabled property of the user then we delete the confirmationEntity.

So when we run the application and the perfrom a GET request to "/verify/account" with a query parameter named "key"
we got a response with a 200 status and a response body containing a message indicating that the account has been
verified.
Then when we run it again to get the user, we got an error confimation key not found.
![img.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg.png)
When we run again
![img_1.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_1.png)

Now we have a way to create a user and also confirm the new user account. Note that the user account
are disables initially when they account is created.

```java
  public static UserEntity createUserEntity(String firstName, String lastName, String email, RoleEntity role) {
    return UserEntity.builder()
        .userId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
        .accountNonExpired(true)
        .accountNonLocked(true)
        .mfa(false)
        .enabled(false)

} 
```

### Creating the Security Filter Chain

First we created a security filter chain that helps to filter the request coming
from the client and then send it to the next filter. However for testing purpose i want to
able to permit some path to go through the filter so it doesnt get authenticated.

```java

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)
        .authorizeHttpRequests(request ->
            request.requestMatchers("/user/login").permitAll() //For every http request that matches a specific pattern permit them.
                .anyRequest().authenticated()) //Any other user that does match "Authenticate them"
        .build();
}
```

### Creating the Authentication Manager

After creating the security filter chain we can now create the Authentiucation Manager, this will
help us to manager the authentication of the user, the authentication manager will recieve the
request for the filter chain and attemps to authentiate the user based on the provided credentials.

```java
 public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    DaoAuthenticationProvider daoAuthenticationProvider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
    daoAuthenticationProvider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService);
    return new ProviderManager(daoAuthenticationProvider);
}
```

The Authentication manager use the authentication provider tohandle the authentication process thats
why i am passing in the userdetailsservcies as a param. The authentication provider has a
`doauthenticationprovider` method that will attempt to authenticate the user so we have to pass in the
userdetails to the dao authentication provider which will then attempt to `authenticate` the user.
The `DoaAuthenticationProvider` has an `authenticate` method, this method has `unauthenticated` and `authenticated`.

### PostMappinng method for login

```java

@PostMapping("/login")
public ResponseEntity<?> test(@RequestBody UserRequest user) {
    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken unauthenticated = UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.unauthenticated(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());
    Authentication authenticate = authenticationManager.authenticate(unauthenticated);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(Map.of("user", authenticate));
}
```

This code snippet defines a POST endpoint for user login. It receives a JSON request body containing user credentials
(user.getEmail() and user.getPassword()). It creates an UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken object with the provided
email and password, and then authenticates the user using the authenticationManager. Finally, it returns a
ResponseEntity with an OK status and a response body containing a map with the key "user" and the value of the
authenticated user.
The `unauthenticated` method is called when the user does not exist in the database.

```java
    public static UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken unauthenticated(Object principal, Object credentials) {
    return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(principal, credentials);
}
```

The `authenticated` method is called when the user exists in the database.

```java
   public static UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authenticated(Object principal, Object credentials, Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities) {
    return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(principal, credentials, authorities);
}
```

### Breakdown

Now we have created our won Security Filter Chain, Authentication Manager, UserDetailsService and PostMapping for login,
so we
have taken the responsibility from spring security, now what i need to do next is create our own
authentication provider so we can then pass it the userdatails comming from the database.

## Additional Notes

### Testing Spring Security(Learning Before Impl)

So far we have been able to do this:
![img_2.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_2.png)
Though i havent done: User should be able to login into the application that because i havent created the UI
of the application but pretty much the backend for it has been created.

So the next thing we will be working on is the login functionalities.
![img_3.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_3.png)
In this login i am going to make use of spring security.

Note
For Securing our API, I will be using the Custom Token Implementation of Spring Security becuase spring
security is very powerful and its uses in alot on enterprise application.

### Custom Token Implememtation

So initially I had the dependency for spring security commented, so the first thing i will do is uncomment
the dependency then i will run the application.
After running the application a password was generated, and now i tried to get the the register user with the token
but it gave an `401 Unauthorized` error this is becuase we enables spring security and by default spring
gave us a username and a password which was generated when we run the application so now the best approach to getting
the
user will be.
Choosing the choosing auth and then using the basic auth option in postman, this will ask to enter the user name
and the password for authentication.
So the username will be `user` because it is by default and the password will be the password generated at runtime.
When we then send the request to get the user again we then, get the error user not found which I expected to get
because we already set the token to be deleted after verifying a user.
![img_4.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_4.png)
> Note
> By default spring security gives a form authentication with the basic auth so its basic and form authentication.  
> ![img_5.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_5.png)
>
> ![img_6.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_6.png)

#### Overriding the User Details Services

So what we going to do now is, instead of using spring default users and password, we are going to create our own
users like a custom user so we going to have to to override the default user manager system.
So what we will first did was create a new package called security then inside this secueity package,
everything related to the security is inside this package, so then we created an `FilterChainConfiguaration`
inside this class we created two custom users `daniel` and `james` they each have their username and password.
After we create these user we then return this user in other to override the default InMemoryUserDetailsManager
users.
Now we will run the aplication again and try to filln the form with these customer user credentials,
and now when we run it we got the same error without the unauthorized 401 error.
![img_7.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_7.png)
so now if i go to the browser and i then enter the credentials we will get something like this:
![img_8.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_8.png)
![img_6.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_6.png)

```java

@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    //First User
    var daniel = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
        .username("daniel")
        .password("letdanin")
        .roles("USER")
        .build();
    //Second User
    var james = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
        .username("james")
        .password("letjamesin")
        .roles("USER")
        .build();
    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(List.of(daniel, james)); //Override the user in memory user details with our custom user.
}
```

So far we only did the User Details service part, the other three are still on the default (Filters, Authentication
Manager, Authentication Provider). The only thing weve override is the in memory user details.

#### Override the Authentication Provider and Authentication Manager

    In other fro use to override the `daoauthenticationProvider` we had to make use of the Authentication Manager
    because they work hand in hand with each other, so then the `daoauthentication` provider override the 
    `userDetailsProvider` values then return the new value. 

So when we run the application and pass in the same user details we got the same message as the last run, so we pass
the filter, so far we have overriden the `AuthenticationManager` and `AuthenticationProvider` with the same method
at the same time and then the `UserDetailServices`.

```java

@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    DaoAuthenticationProvider daoAuthenticationProvider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
    daoAuthenticationProvider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService);
    return new ProviderManager(daoAuthenticationProvider);
}
```

By default all of the endpoint are locked by the springboot authentication, so what we hav to do now is
let springboot know we dont want all path (register, login, password) to go through the filter and only just
send it to the controller because we want the user to be authenticated in other to access the login or regsiter,
or reset password.
> All endpoints in the application are all secure by springboot, we can also tell spring security to not secure a
> specific endpoint and if a request comes in for a specify endpoint just let the request go through and then send
> the response back.

#### Add filter to open up some endpoints

So we created a `SecurityFilterChain` method that basically helps in filtering request so if a specify
request matches a specify pattern for examples url endpoint "user/test" it will permit the request however
other requst will be authorized.

```java

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .authorizeHttpRequests(request ->
            request.requestMatchers("/user/test").permitAll() //For every http request that matches a specific pattern permit them.
                .anyRequest().authenticated()) //Any other user that does match "Authenticate them"
        .build();
}
```

Run the application and send a GET request to:

```http request
http://localhost:8085/user/test
```

And you can see we got a 403 Forbidden error which mean we dont have permission this because we have no route defined in
the application, if we have a route define we will get a 500 server error but so far is it working.
![img_9.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_9.png)

So what we will do now is create a test endpoint in the controller o(`userResource`), just to test the route and filter
once
more. So now if we go back and re test the request we should get a 200 reponse back.
![img_10.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_10.png)
As you can see we got a 200 response back because we told spring to not secure the endpoint.

So what we want to do next is take control of the recieving the request to log a user inton the application,
we have some user define, we have some configuration going on but we are still not recieving any username
adn password, how can we get more control to do this, so we want to create a cmontroler son that we can send
our login user to this controller.

#### Recieving the request (User username and password)

We created a POSTMAPPING post request in other to login the user, so if we want to login we have to go
to `user/login`.

```java

@PostMapping("/login")
public String login(@RequestBody User user, HttpServletRequest request) {
    authenticationManager.authenticate(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.unauthenticated(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword()));
    return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
```

This method acts as a login endpoint. It expects a POST request to "/login" with a request body containing user
credentials (likely in JSON format).
It attempts to authenticate the user using the provided username and password through Spring Security's
AuthenticationManager.
If authentication is successful (specific logic might vary based on your implementation), it returns a successful
HTTP response (status code 200) without an additional response body.

So now we have taken control of the recieving the request to log a user into the application, we have our own
endpoint to login the user.

```java

@PostMapping("/login")
public ResponseEntity<Response> test(@RequestBody UserRequest user) {
    authenticationManager.authenticate(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.unauthenticated(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword()));
    return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
}
```

we have the AuthenticationManager to authenticate the user.

```java
public class UserResource {
    private final UserService userService;
    private final AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;
```

And we are calling the AuthenticationManager because we have define it in the `SecurityFilterChain` method.

```java

@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    DaoAuthenticationProvider daoAuthenticationProvider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
    daoAuthenticationProvider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService);
    return new ProviderManager(daoAuthenticationProvider);
}
```

![img_11.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_11.png)
Now that we have taken control of the user login, we also have to take control of doing our own checks,
like checking if the password maches or not and if the password did not match we log a specific error, by defuly
spring has default password encoder that checks if the password matches and if not it returns a `bad credentials`
message.
![img_12.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_12.png)
But how do we takes this functinalities from spring, how do we take control of it.

### Creating custm Authentication Provider

Whenever we are going to take control of the authentication provider we need to give spring security
our own a userdetails and also an unauthenticated authentication which is going to be our
`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

This authenticate method is responsible for verifying the user's credentials and returning an authenticated
Authentication object
if the credentials are valid.

If the credentials do not match, the method throws a BadCredentialsException indicating that the user is unable to log
in.
It compares the credentials the credentials of the user coming from the request with the credentials of the user
retrieved from the database.
If the credentials match, the method returns a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken object with the authenticated user.

```java

@Override
public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
    var user = (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) authentication; //User coming in from the request.
    //Comparing both users from db and User from Request
    var userFromDb = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername((String) user.getPrincipal()); //Load user
    //if the user credemtials is the same as user from Db credentials.
    if ((user.getCredentials()).equals(userFromDb.getPassword())) {
        return UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.authenticated(userFromDb, "[PASSWORD PROTECTED]", null);
    }
    throw new BadCredentialsException("Unable to login");
}
```

The next thing we have to work on now is the Authority, we need this because we are going to define
the role of the user in the database.

So now that we have created our own authentication provider we have to let spring knon we have our own
authentication provider and since its a bean that makes it easier.
In other to do that we need the tell the manager becuase its the one that is been used to do the authentication.

```java

@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    MyOwnAuthenticationProvider myOwnAuthenticationProvider = new MyOwnAuthenticationProvider(userDetailsService);
    return new ProviderManager(myOwnAuthenticationProvider);
}
```

So now we have our Security Filter chain, UserDetails, Authentication Manager, Authentication Provider.
So now when we run the application we got a 403 error
> Tip
> Keep in mind that Spring send 403 when ever there is any error in the application

Spring was failig because it wasnt able to do the comparison of the credentials, what i did to fix that is
basically the password coming from the authority(users) to string.

```java
var user = (UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) authentication; //User coming in from the request.
//Comparing both users from db and User from Request
var userFromDb = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername((String) user.getPrincipal());
//if the user credentials is the same as user from Db credentials.
var password = (String) user.getCredentials();
//if((user.getCredentials()).equals(userFromDb.getPassword())) {
        if(password.
equals(userFromDb.getPassword())){
    return UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.
authenticated(userFromDb, "[PASSWORD PROTECTED]",userFromDb.getAuthorities());
    }
```

And also because we have an encoder (defaultpasswordencoder), what i did to fix that is basically cancle our the
password encoder and then pass in {noop} signifing that the password is not encrypted.

```java

@Bean
public UserDetailsService inMemoryUserDetailsManager() {
    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
        User.withUsername("Daniel")
            .password("{noop}letjamesin")
            .roles("USER")
            .build(),
        User.withUsername("Daniel")
            .password("{noop}letjamesin")
            .roles("USER")
            .build()
    );
}
```

Then we rerun, because we dont have any password encoder at all we dont need the `{noop}`.
We are able to login sucessfully:
![img_15.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_15.png)
and if we provide a bad password, we get a 403 forbidden error
![img_16.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_16.png)

And that one approach to configure spring security for a more beoader understading I design a PKM explaining
Spring Security.
![img_17.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_17.png)

## Main Spring Security Implementation

### Logic Features Intro

Todo: Load the Schema.sql and Data.sql in other to create the tables and add constraints.

### Authentication Part 1

Now we will implement the following functinalities using what i've learn
in spring security.
![img_13.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_13.png)

### Api Authentication

This is the equivalent of the usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken
It contains the user that we are going to be working with in the application when we are not dealing with the
application or saving to the database.
We will have some kind of mapper that is going to take the user from the database and then maps
it to this class(User class) and vise versal.

So now that we have created the user class,we need to extend the authentitcation and make sure we can pput
in the same pattern that we saw with `usernamepasswordAuthenticationToken`.
We extended the abstract authentication token because that class has some certain method that are just convinient
working
with.

We created two constructor, the one we vare going to call when ever we are are going to start the authentication,

```java
    public ApiAuthentication(String email, String password) {
    super(AuthorityUtils.NO_AUTHORITIES);
    this.password = email;
    this.email = password;
    this.authenticated = false;
}
```

And the one we call when the user has been authenticated

```java
    public ApiAuthentication(User user, Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities) {
    super(authorities);
    this.user = user;
    this.password = PASSWORD_PROTECTED;
    this.email = EMAIL_PROTECTED;
    this.authenticated = true;
}
```

So we dont want to call the constructor diretly so we make them public and then create two public
static `unauthenticated and authenticated method`
The unauthenticated method is returning the email and password because that is what we passes in the request and when we
staring the
authentication.

```java
  public static ApiAuthentication unauthenticated(String email, String password) {
    return new ApiAuthentication(email, password);
}
```

And the authenticated is returning the user and the authorities, we use this when the authentication is successful.
We will call this so that we can create the actual fully authenticated user.

```java
    public static ApiAuthentication authenticated(User user, Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities) {
    return new ApiAuthentication(user, authorities);
}
```

Also becuase we dont want the password to be seen we passed in the PASSWORD PROTECTED to the credentials.
We then created a `setAuthentication` method because we want to make sure that they call the authentication
because we dont want anyone to be able to set the authentication with a setter so we have to make sure that.

```java

@Override
public void setAuthenticated(boolean authenticated) {
    throw new ApiException("You cannot set authentication");
}

```

Then we also create the `isAuthenticated` method and we retuen the autheticated boolean values for when ever we
have a fully authenticated user.

```java

@Override
public boolean isAuthenticated() {
    return this.authenticated;
}
```

So that is all for my authentication so i have my own class with my authentication and then when ever we
want we can pass in email and the password whenm ever we have an unAuthenticated authentication or Api
authentication or when ever the user is fully authentiacated we are going to call the constructor and pass in
the user and also authorities, spring by defauklt needs the authorities so that why we are passing in the `super`

```java
  private ApiAuthentication(String email, String password) {
    super(AuthorityUtils.NO_AUTHORITIES);
```

and also the contructors are private so that they can be use and we are forcing everyone to use the
unauthenticated and then the authenticated helper method.Thats all we dont have to rely on the
`usernamepasswordauthenticationtoken` given by spring security.

### Login Filter

What we want to do now is create a filter similar to the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` this ist he filter
class that intercept the request coming in and then it tries to do the authentication and spring is using a
filter to do this so its only write that we also use a filter with the same pattern they had in mind.

So now instead of having our endpoint in our resources we are nnot going to do it this way

```java
//Before
@PostMapping("/login")
public ResponseEntity<?> test(@RequestBody UserRequest user) {
```

We are going to have this endpoints in the filter and then we are going to authenticate all the request coming in using
the filter so thats what I am going to be working on next.

We created a new class `Authentication filter` extending the abstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter then reason why I am
extending
this class is because it is a good class to use if you just want to do the authentication.

After we implemented the `atemptAuthentication` this is the method that gets called when we want to initiates the
authentication
process.

Then we created a constructor this helps whenever we want to pass something to the super class..
the authenticationFilter basically helps to tell the super class that for any Post Request that comes for the
path(/user/login) then it's the ome it should listen-to to trigger the `attemptAuthentication` method.

```java
 public AuthenticationFilter(AuthenticationManager authenticationManager, UserService, JwtService jwtService) {
    super(new AntPathRequestMatcher("/user/login", POST.name()), authenticationManager);
}
```

then we importted the userservice and the Jwtservice, the `userServices` for when we need to featch the user whenever
we get their username from the request and we need to update their login attemps and do some other things.

So now we need to define some method in the userservices so that we can update the login attempt and we are also going
to
need the JWT services so that we can pass in a token to the response.
For the response we implement another method called the `successfulAuthentication` this gets called when ever the
authenticamtion is successful.

So far the class is is listening on user login and then its going to call the `attemptAuthentication` and if the
authentication is successful, it going to call `successfulAuthentication`.

So now we are going to be working on the userServices so that we can update the login attempt of the user.

### Filtering Login 2

The first thing we are going to do is define some ENUM, we created a class called `LoginType` this class
will give us the type of login that is happening.

```java
public enum LoginType {
    LOGIN_ATTEMPT, LOGIN_SUCCESS
}
```

Also I am not creating a converted for this enums because we are not saving these to the database so they dont
need to be converted to columns and all.

So in our userservices we created a new field called `updateLoginAttempt` we are creating this so we can basically
update the
login attempt so then we can update how many times a userlogin into the application to keep track so that we can lock
their account. So it will update it in the database.

```java
    void updateLoginAttempt(String email, LoginType loginType);
```

So now we will implement the method, in the method `updateLoginAttempt` we getting the user entity by email and also
getting the
user id so in case something is saved in the database we know who did it and then we are also creating a sitch to switch
between the loginTypes -> LOGIN ATTEMPT AND LOGIN_SUCCESS.

In the LOGIN ATTEMPT -> if its a login attept we need to check to see if the user has already been in the **_cache_**.
The **_cache_** we dont have yet and still needs to create and then if the user is not the cache then we need to set
their login attempt to ZERO(0) then give a message ('Your account not locked').

Otherwise we need to increase their login attempt and if their login attempt is bigger than 5, like 6 or greater then we
are going to lock their account.

In the LOGIN SUCCESS -> They are going to reset their account because we are going to set their login attempt to
ZERO(0) and them remove them from the cache and set their last login to the current instance because that means they
logged in
successfully.

So what we need now is the cache because if we dont have the cache, their is not way we are going ton knw if the user
is in the **_cache_** of not and what login attempt that they have.

### User Cache

So first go to your browser and type in `google guava maven`, click on the maven link showing first and
click on the latest version, I would advise version 33.0.0jre because its still the most stable version.
Then after the download head to your `pom` file and add the copied dependency.

Then after that we created a new package called cache, anything cache related is going to be inside of this cache
package. Then we created a class called cacheStore that takes in a Key and a Value.
A key and a value is uaully what is needed when every we need to cache anything in an application.

Then we created a cnstructor called cacheStore, that takes in an expiry Duration and a TimeUnit, so
when ever we create a construtor for the type we want to cache, it going to build the cache and then wait for
a certain duration of time before it then expires.

The cache store takes the key and the value for the type of cache that you need to creates, so if you need to pass
in a String, and then a User, the K(Key) will be the string and trhe V(Value) will be the User.

```java
public class CacheStore<K, V> {
```

so whatever value that we pass in the K and the V will be the value that is then passed into the catual cache.

```java
 private final Cache<K, V> cache;
```

In other to create a cache with the use of tis constructor

```java
    public CacheStore(int expiryDuration, TimeUnit timeUnit) {
    //Example: Expiry duration = 5, TimeUnit = Min -> 5 min
    cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
        .expireAfterWrite(expiryDuration, timeUnit)
        .concurrencyLevel(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors())
        .build();
}
```

- Getting from the cache
  Then whenever we need to get a value from the cache, is going to be through(by) the type that was
  define as the value. Because we are getting the values and the key is going to be the key of the cache.
  Example: Let say the values is a User and then the Key is a String so if you waant to get the `user` you
  have to pass in the String which is the key.

```java
   public V get(@NotNull K key) {
    log.info("Retrieving from Cache with Key {} ", key.toString());
    return cache.getIfPresent(key);
}
```

- Putting into the Cache

```java
    public void put(@NotNull K key, @NotNull V value) {
    log.info("Putting into Cache with Key {} and Value {}", key.toString(), value.toString());
    cache.put(key, value);
}
```

This method takes in the key and the value which are both needed in other to put something into the cache.

- Removing from the Cache

```java
    public void remove(@NotNull K key) {
    log.info("Removing from Cache with Key {} ", key.toString());
    cache.invalidate(key);
}
```

In we want to remove from the cache this method takes in a key and then helps to invalidate the
cache based on the key.
So that is all about the cache store, how ever this is just a cache store we have to do an implementation
of the cache store. Thats what we going to be working on next.

### Cache Configuration

Now that we have the cache store we can define bean for specific implementations, we can pretty much use this
cache store for any key value pair that we want to cache.
We are going to create an other class in the same cache pakage, in the class we created a cache `userCache`
where we can pass in a key for the String and an Integer for the Value and its going to
expire after 900 sec which is a min. All the values and entries of the cache are going to
expire after 900 sec of the time that we put them in the cache.

So now we have the cache and we can also create another cache if we want we can create as many
cache as we want.

```js
public

class CacheConfig {
  @Bean(name = "userLoginCache")
  public CacheStore<String, Integer>

  userCache () {
    return new CacheStore < > (900, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  }
```

But we will stick with this for now what we are going to do now that we have the cache is go back to
the login attempt method in the userserviceimpl class and imput our logic.

So the logic updateLoginAttempt. we have a swtich statement that is going to check if the login type is
LOGIN ATTEMPT or LOGIN SUCCESS.

In the case of -> LOGIN ATTEMPT:  it checks if the user not in the cache, and if the user is not in the cache, it then
set the
login attemto 0 and then set the account non lock to true, meaning the user account is not locked.
Otherwise, if the user is already in the cache meaning the user already tries to login then it increase their
loginattempt
by 1, and then put thier email and their loginattemps numbers in the cache.
It also check if the user login attempt is greater than 5, if it is then it locks their account.
Then we save the user
In the case of -> LOGIN SUCCESS: We set the account non lock to true, meaning the user account is not locked,
set their login attempts to 0, and remove them from the cache.
Then we save the user.

Now that we have done the updateLoginAttempt method we need to find a way to get the logic credentials from the
HttpServletRequest
and pass that into the authentication manage so that we can trigger the authentication process.

```java

@Override
public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException, IOException, ServletException {
    userService.updateLoginAttempt("danielolaibi@gmail.com", LOGIN_ATTEMPT);
    return null;
}
```

- Update login credential from httpserveletrequest
  First we are going to define a new Request -> Login Request in the dto package,
  How that we have the request we will try to map the value from the request to the
  email and the password in the Login Request.

So after we created update login attempt, we then try to get the login credentials from the http request, in other for
us
to do that we have to create a new login request class that has the emial and password fields then map the
email and password coming from the httpservlet request to the `loginRequest` email and password.

```java
public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException, IOException, ServletException {
    try {
        //Grab the user information to create the authentication after getting the login types
        var user = new ObjectMapper().configure(AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE, true).readValue(request.getInputStream(), LoginRequest.class);
```

After maping the crediential we the call the userservices to update the login attempt by passing the email
gotten fromn the mapped credentials.

```java
  var user = new ObjectMapper().configure(AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE, true).readValue(request.getInputStream(), LoginRequest.class);
            userService.
updateLoginAttempt(user.getEmail(),LOGIN_ATTEMPT);
```

Then we try to create the authentication object which takes an unauthenticated authentication, pass in the credentials
and then
get the authenticationManager and then authenticate the user.

```java
  var authentication = ApiAuthentication.unauthenticated(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());
//Pass the credentials to the authentication manager
            return
getAuthenticationManager().
authenticate(authentication);
```

### Error Response

Class(RequestUtils.java)
In the attempt authentication method we used a try catch block to handle the exception in case there is an error while
trying to
authenticate the user.
So now we will work on the handleErrorResponse method, this method is to handle an error response by
writing the error response inside the response body of the http request,response.

- handleErrorResponse method
  If the exception is an instance of AccessDeniedException, it calls the getErrorResponse method to get an error
  response object
  with the appropriate status code and error message. Then, it calls the writeResponse method to write the error
  response inside
  the response body of the response object.
  This method provides a way to handle and respond to errors during the authentication process.

- The getErrorResponse method gets an error response based on the given parameter, it takes in the
  request and reponse http servlet and an exception and a status code, it then checks if the reponse contentype
  to a application_json_values and also set the status code of the response, it then returns an error response object.

```java
   private static Response getErrorResponse(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Exception exception, HttpStatus status) {
    response.setContentType(APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE);
    response.setStatus(status.value());
    return new Response(now().toString(), status.value(), request.getRequestURI(), HttpStatus.valueOf(status.value()), errorResponse.apply(exception, status), getRootCauseMessage(exception), emptyMap());
}
}
```

Then we created an helper method that helps to writeResponse the given handleErrorResponse method object to the
output stream of the HttpServletResponse using an ObjectMapper.
This method is designed to handle the serialization of the response object and send it back as a response in an
HTTP servlet context. The method ensures that the output stream is flushed after writing the response and catches any
exceptions that occur during the process, rethrowing them as an ApiException.

Overall, all this was done so if we have an exception in the attenpt authentication method, we will get a well formatted
error response.

So the next thing that we need to work on is the successful authentication process and for this we are going to need the
JWT service so thats
what we are going to be working in next.

### JWT Services part 1

Todo: In these approah we are going to make sure we add the token in a secure only cookie.
First we created an interface for JwtServices, then in side this interface we define the following methods,

- CreateToken - This method helps to create a Jwt token for the USER. It takes in the user object and a
  funtion token object as a parameter. The aim of the funtion is to convert a jwt token to a string representation
  of the token, the method return a string representing the created token.
- extractToken - The method takes an an HttpServletRequest object and a tokenType string as parameters.
  The aim of the method is to extract the token from the request and return it as a string.
- addCookie - The method add a cookie to an HttpServletResponse object. The method add a cookie to the response with the
  user's token and token type.
- getTokenData - This method extract token data from a JWT token. The method takes in a token as a string.
  It takes a String token and a Function<TokenData, T> object as parameters.
  The Function<TokenData, T> object is used to convert a TokenData object to a generic type T.
  The method returns the extracted token data.

So before the proceed with the method we have to define the token first, so in the domain package we created a token
class,
which has two fields one is the access and one is the refresh.
The access token fields allow us to access the token and the refresh token allows us to refresh the token..

The next thing we want to also do is define the token data, so we created a new class tokenData inside this class,w e
defined
the fields, user, claims, valid and authorities.
The use is going to be the user associated with the token and the claims is going to be the claims associated with the
token
and the valid is going to be a boolean that indicates if the token is valid or not and the authorities is going to be
the
authorities associated with the token.

Now that we have the token data we need to define the token type, which is going to be an enum so we
will create an enum class inside this class we define the token type enum.
ACCESS, REFRESH, the access enum has a valu of "access-token" and the refresh enum has a value of "refresh-token"..
Then we define a field value which will allow us to later get the value of the token type .

JWT PART 2
So now we need to give an implementation for all these methods which are in the JWTService
business layer package, so what we did fi rs₫t was head to the `jjwt gitgub lirary` and then copy the maven dependency
and added it to the POM file so now we have it in our class path as our dependencies.

Then we import the claims from the libabry in the `TokenData` class, then next thing we will do is give an
implementation for the methods in the `JwtService` class and also a JwtConfig class.
The Jwt config is going to fetch some configuration for us.

In the Jwtconfig file class, we defien two values which are expirating and secret, the expiration is
the expiration time of the token and the secret is the secret key for the token. However we did not directly
pass in the values, what we did was pass in the values from the environment variables, then define the values fro the
environment variables the application.yml file. We set the expiration to 5 days so the token will expire after 5 days.

```java
public class JwtConfiguration {
    @Value("${jwt.expiration}")
    private Long expiration;
    @Value("${jwt.secret}")
    private String secret;
}
```

When we going to run the application then we will pass in the secret key..

After we head back to the JwtServicesImpl and extend the JwtConfig also implement the JwtService.

```java

@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Slf4j
public class JwtServiceImpl extends JwtConfiguration implements JwtService {
}
```

Then we implement the methods for this class, so that we can create a token and extract a token., add a cookie and get
token data.
We implemented our first helper method, SecretKey, the method takes in the secret key (Featch it for us) from the
environment variables.

- Key fields

```java
private final Supplier<SecretKey> Key = () -> Keys.hmacShaKeyFor(Decoders.BASE64.decode(getSecret()));
```

- Claims Fields
  Secondly we create another field function that takes in a String(token) and return the `claims` claims are data that
  we
  set on the token. This is goin to give us the claims associated with the tokens.

```java
   private final Function<String, Claims> claimsFunction = token ->
    Jwts.parser()
        .verifyWith(key.get())
        .build()
        .parseSignedClaims(token)
        .getPayload();
```

- Claim Sibject fields
  Thirdly we created another one, we are going to give it the token and it is goig to give us the
  subject, which is the claims Subject.
- Authorities
  Forth we are going to create another for the authorities, this method is to construct a list of GrantedAutheorities
  Object
  based on the claims present in the token. The method takes a token as input, retrieves the values of two claims from
  the token
  (one claim representing authorities and the other claim representing a role), and combines them into a comma-separated
  string.
  The resulting string is then passed to a function named commaSeparatedStringToAuthorityList, which is assumed to
  convert the
  string into a list of GrantedAuthority objects. The resulting list of GrantedAuthority objects is then returned as the
  result
  of the method.

### Jwt part 4

Next we need another helper method to extract the token,the extractoken method will return an optional of stream(
something)
otherwise it will throw an error. When we call get cookies and it is null then a new array will be created with
the values of empty because we dont just want it to return when it cant find any cookies otherwise it will call the
getCookie.
So basically it will filter the request for the cookies, map the cookie to the values and return it.

```java
 private final BiFunction<HttpServletRequest, String, Optional<String>> extractToken = (request, cookieName) ->
    Optional.of(stream(request.getCookies() == null ? new Cookie[]{new Cookie(EMPTY_VALUE, EMPTY_VALUE)} : request.getCookies())
            .filter(cookie -> Objects.equals(cookieName, cookie.getName()))
            .map(Cookie::getValue)
            .findAny())
        .orElse(empty());
```

Then we define an other method extractcookie, this method is forgetting the cookie itself, a bit similar to the
extracttoken,
where we were trying to get value of the cookie.

Then we define a JWT Builder which will be use to create a JWT, the builder is configured to set the header of the JWT
to contain
a single entry with the key "type" and the value "JWT". The audience (recipient) of the JWT is set to "
THE_IN3ROVERT_LLC". The id
(unique identifier) of the JWT is set to a randomly generated UUID. The issued at (creation time) of the JWT is set to
the current
time. The not before (start time) of the JWT is set to the current time. Finally, the JWT is signed with a specified key
and the
HS512 signature algorithm.

### Jwt part 5(6)

After creating the builder we then need a mthod that is going to add the cookie to the response, i want
this cookie to be a consumer cookie and also want it to accept three values so I created a functional interface class
named `triConsumer` this class is going to take three arguments and accept them.

After i created the addCookie method i need to add a method that is going to add the cookie to the response. Because we
need
to know if its a access token that we will be working with or its a refresh token so we will be using a switch
statement.

The aim and objective of the addCookie method is to add a cookie to the HttpServletResponse object. The method takes
three
arguments: the HttpServletResponse object, a User object, and a TokenType object.
The method uses a switch statement to determine the type of token being added. If the type is ACCESS, it creates an
access
token for the user using the createToken method and the Token::getAccess function. It then creates a new Cookie object
with
the token value and sets various properties such as HttpOnly, MaxAge, and Path. Finally, it adds the cookie to the
HttpServletResponse object using the addCookie method.
Overall, the addCookie method is used to add a cookie to the response when the user logs in or performs an action that
requires authentication.
Then in the case of the refresh token it does the same thing.

So what i want to do now is understand the code and come back before proceeding to the methods.

-- Date: 29/08/20024
Today we want to work on the authentication filter, when ever the authentication filter gets called it is going to call
the
authentication and when the authentication is successsful, then its going to call the successful
authentication method, so what we want to do now is, assuming that the authentication is successful, we are going to do
whatevr
we need to do with the authentication, the response, the filter chain or with the request because we have access to
everything we need
inside of the authentication.

So for the successfulAuthentication method, now if the user login and the autentcation is successful, the update login
attempt
gets triggers and then a login attempt is updated.

```java
  var user = (User) authentication.getPrincipal(); //This is going to be user.
        userService.
updateLoginAttempt(user.getEmail(),LOGIN_SUCCESS);
```

So now wnat we need to do is determine what kind of response we need to send back to the user, when the login is
successful,
because if the user is using mfa we need to send them a diff message and if they are not using mfa we also need to send
a diff message.

So we created a var `httpResponse` then we use a mapper to write the body of our `httpResponse` to the
`servletHttpResponse`, so its going to look like a normal controller return these values.
So now we have to to work on the important method, `sendRessponse` and `sendQrCode` .

The sendResponse method add cookie to the httpServletResponse and then construct a Response object with the information
about
the user and a success message.
The SendQrcode method is going to send the qrcode to the user if the user has MFA enabled.

So what we want to do next is go back and work on the authentication provider, and also need to work on the filterchain
config class
alo, this has to be done before we run the application.

Based on our previous AuthenticationProvider class, we passed in the UserDetailsServices related to spring security, but
that was just for testing case, now
that we have our own user details service we are just going to pass in our own user services.

The authenticate method represents the authentication logic in a custom authentication provider. It verifies the user's
credentials by checking if the user exists,
if the credentials are not expired, and if the passwords match. If all conditions pass, it returns an authenticated
ApiAuthentication. Otherwise, it handles exceptions for expired
credentials or incorrect login attempts. If the user does not exist, it throws an exception stating that the user could
not be authenticated.

The next thing we need to do, is work on the method we define in the authenticate method, which are the
getCredentialsById and getUserByEmail methods and we also have to define a bean for the BCryptPasswordEncoder.

### User Services Implementation

Currently all the user services implementation are returning null, that needs to be fixed.

The getUserByUserId method retrieves a user from the repository based on their user ID. If the user is not found, it
throws an ApiException with the message "User not found".
The getUserByEmail method retrieves a user from the repository based on their email.
The getUserCredentialById method retrieves the credentials of a user from the repository based on their user ID. If the
credentials are not found, it throws an ApiException with the message "Unable to find user credentials".

```java
    //Retrieve users based on their id
@Override
public User getUserByUserId(String userId) {
    var userEntity = userRepository.findUserByUserId(userId).orElseThrow(() -> new ApiException("User not found"));
    return fromUserEntity(userEntity, userEntity.getRole(), getUserCredentialById(userEntity.getId()));
}

//Retrieve users based on their email
@Override
public User getUserByEmail(String email) {
    UserEntity userEntity = getUserEntityByEmail(email);

    return fromUserEntity(userEntity, userEntity.getRole(), getUserCredentialById(userEntity.getId()));
}
//Retrieve users credentials based on their id
@Override
public CredentialEntity getUserCredentialById(Long userId) {
    var credentialById = credentialRepository.getCredentialEntitiesById(userId);
    return credentialById.orElseThrow(() -> new ApiException("Unable to find user credentials"));
}
```

The next thing we have to work on is the user principal, we have to put an impelmentation for all of the methods, all of
the informationn
we need to do that is already in the user, so we just need to pass in the user to the user principal.

## User Principal

What we are going to work on today is the user principal, we need to put in an implementation for all the methods,
So what we did was return the values associated with the methods in the userpricipal class, the methods from user entity
in the
UserUtil class has the necessary properties needed for the user so we basically return those properties that is needed
by the
userprincipal.

```java
 public static User fromUserEntity(UserEntity userEntity, RoleEntity role, CredentialEntity credentialEntity) {
    User user = new User();
    BeanUtils.copyProperties(userEntity, user); //Copy all the fields from the userEntity and put in the user.
    user.setLastLogin(userEntity.getLastLogin().toString());
    user.setCredentialsNonExpired(isCredentialsNonExpired(credentialEntity));
    user.setCreatedAt(userEntity.getCreatedAt().toString());
    user.setUpdatedAt(userEntity.getUpdatedAt().toString());
    user.setRoles(role.getName());
    user.setAuthorities(role.getAuthorities().getValue());
    return user;
}
```

```java
    public String getUsername() {
    return user.getEmail();
}

@Override
public boolean isAccountNonExpired() {
    return user.isAccountNonExpired();
}
```

So what i am going to work on next is the encoder for the password, so i am going to create a new class called security
config,
we just need to define the BCryptPasswordEncoder bean becuase we want to use it to encode the password of the
application.

```java
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(STRENGTH);
    }
}
```

One lasy thing we have to work on is the authorisation filter, this is the filter that we have to work on before we
intercept any
request, because this is the filter that is going to intercept every request, and determine which route that user
is trying to access and if the uses has access to this route, like if the user is authenticated or not.

## Authrisation filter 1

These filter will be the one to determine if the user is authenticated or not and also where will
put the login that change if the access token is expired.

So first we create a new method called doFilterInternal, this method is going to intercept the request and determine if
the user
is authenticated or not, first it extract the token from the request then it checks if the token is expired or not
and if its valid, when true it then create an authenticaion then set the authentication into the securitycontextkholder,
and then it set the userId into the request context.

```java
 protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        //First we extract the token 
        var accessToken = jwtService.extractToken(request, ACCESS.getValue());
        //Check if the accessToken is present and valid
        if (accessToken.isPresent() && jwtService.getTokenData(accessToken.get(), TokenData::isValid)) {
            //Set the authentication in the current thread
            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(getAuthentication(accessToken.get(), request));
            //Tell it who is logged in
            RequestContext.setUserId(jwtService.getTokenData(accessToken.get(), TokenData::getUser).getId());
        } else {
        }
```

> What is a securityContextholder and what is the use.

The getAuthentication method that helps to get the authentication before we set it into the securityContextHolder
is a helper method that takes in a token and a request object and returns an authentication object.

```java
  private Authentication getAuthentication(String token, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var authentication = ApiAuthentication.authenticated(jwtService.getTokenData(token, TokenData::getUser), jwtService.getTokenData(token, TokenData::getAuthorities));
    authentication.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
    return authentication;
}
```

## Authentication fiilter 2

So what we want to do next is that whenever the Access token is false or expired meaning if its not present, then
we are going to look for the refresh token and then from the refresh token we will generate a new access token.

In the refresh token method we first extract the token from the request and then get the values of the refresh token,
after that
we check if the refresh token is valid or not, if it is valid then we extract the user from the token and then set the
authentication in the securityContextHolder by first creating authenticated a new access token before setting it into
the
securityContextHolder.
Then we created a new cookie and set the cookie into the response object and pass the userId into the request context

Its kind of similar to the access token method just a bit different becuase we created a new token if its a refresh
token,
However is there is not access or refresh token we just clear the securityContextHolder.

```java
 }else{
var refreshToken = jwtService.extractToken(request, REFRESH.getValue());
                if(refreshToken.
isPresent() &&jwtService.
getTokenData(refreshToken.get(),TokenData::isValid)){
//If the request token exist then a new token has to be created for the user
var user = jwtService.getTokenData(refreshToken.get(), TokenData::getUser);
//Set into the security context a newly created access token and then set it to the authentication
                    SecurityContextHolder.
getContext().
setAuthentication(getAuthentication(jwtService.createToken(user, Token::getAccess),request));
    //Then we create a new cookie
    jwtService.
addCookie(response, user, ACCESS);
//Pass it to the Request Context
                    RequestContext.
setUserId(user.getId());
    }else{
    //Todo: For clearing the context if we dont have an access token adn a refresh token
    SecurityContextHolder.
clearContext();
                }
                    }
```

##Authentication filter 3
So what we are going to do next is the condition for when we want to call the `doInternalFilter` method or when it shuld
execute, we are just cheking for when we have a access or refresh filter but not when we wnat to actually use the
fillter which
is what we will be working on next.
We basically wnat to check if the refresh or access token is coming for the regsiter, login or reset password,w e could
have
added it to the `doInternalFilter` method but i dont thnk that is the best way to do it.

So we created a shouldNotFilter method which is a method that belongs to the OnePerRequestFilter class, the method
checks if
the request equals to some certain URL that we dont want to filter, we have some public endpoint that we dont want to
filter
so it it is, it just sets the UserId to the request context.

```java
    protected boolean shouldNotFilter(HttpServletRequest request) throws ServletException {
    var shouldNotFilter = request.getMethod().equalsIgnoreCase(OPTIONS_HTTP_METHOD) || Arrays.asList(PUBLIC_ROUTES).contains(request.getRequestURI());
    if (shouldNotFilter) {
        RequestContext.setUserId(0L);
    }
    return shouldNotFilter;
}
```

So thats all for the filter for now, what we want to work on next is finsh up two more peice of the
`filterchainConfiguration` before we can
finsh up the comfiguration and this is going to happen here.

```java

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)
        .authorizeHttpRequests(request ->
            request.requestMatchers(LOGIN_PATH).permitAll() //For every http request that matches a specific pattern permit them.
                .anyRequest().authenticated()) //Any other user that does match "Authenticate them"
        .build();
}
```

## Exception handler

So the first piece we will finsh with today is the Exception handler, so we create a new package called
handler and then a class called ApiAuthenticationHandle this class implement the AccessDeniedHandler and the
main aim of this class is to handle the exception that is thrown by the `doFilterInternal` method.

Then we create a new class called the AuthenticationEntryPoint this class implemented the AuthenticationEntryPoint, the
entry point is
where the athenticationis going to be throwing an exception if there is an exception and the accessdeniedhandler is for
if we have an access denied exception
So thats all, basically just some overriding so that we can send the request we want to send the way we want it to to be
sent. Doing this
becuase we want to always send the same response every single time incase we want to do some other logic with the
errors.

## Http Configurer

So the next thing we want to do is, in other to make sure that we can keep the filterChainConfiguration a little bit
cleaner, we will
define something called an http configurer.

So we created a new class called the `ApiHtttpConfigurer` and then we override two need methods in this class,
the `init` method and the `configure` method.

The init method is where we do all our initialization like passing in our userdetails service or authtication provider
and many more why.
The configure is where we do all the configuration for the filter chain.
So bascally we created a custom configurer for our API by setting up special filters like the authenntication provider
and the
authentication manager to handle the auth and authorization of the Http requests.

The AuthorizationFilter is a custom filter that is added before the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter. It is
responsible for performing authorization checks and validating access permissions for the incoming requests.

The AuthenticationFilter is another custom filter that is added after the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter. It is
responsible for authenticating the user based on the provided credentials and generating a JWT token
for further authentication. It requires the authenticationConfiguration.getAuthenticationManager(), userService, and
jwtService objects to perform its functions.

By adding these filters, the code ensures that security checks are performed at the appropriate stages of the request
processing pipeline, enhancing the overall security of the API.

## Filter Chain Confiig

## Now that we have the Exception Handler, AuthenticationFilter and AuthorizationFilter we can add them to the filterChainConfiguration

So we dont need the authentication manager called in the filter chain anymore, because we now called the authentication
manager
in the ApiHttpConfigurer class.

```java
  public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.addFilterBefore(authorizationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    http.addFilterAfter(new AuthenticationFilter(authenticationConfiguration.getAuthenticationManager(), userService, jwtService), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
}
```

And also because we have our users in the database now we dont need the userdetailservice also.

```java
    public UserDetailsService inMemoryUserDetailsManager() {
    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
        User.withUsername("Daniel")
            .password("letdanin")
            .roles("USER")
            .build(),
        User.withUsername("james")
            .password("letjamesin")
            .roles("USER")
            .build()
    );
}
```

So we basically working with the securityFilterChain method only, we will need the csrf and also the
corsConfigurer in the filter chain configuration and we also need to set the session to be stateless because we
are dealing with token we dont have any cookie that we're tracking for the logged in user. We are still using the cookie
to save the token but we are not doing a cookie authentication.

This code snippet defines a method securityFilterChain that configures security filters for HTTP requests. It sets up
CSRF
protection, CORS configuration, session management policy, exception handling, and authorization rules for various HTTP
methods
and endpoints. Finally, it applies additional HTTP configurations and builds the security filter chain.

## CORS CONFIG

This code defines a method corsConfigurationSource that creates and configures a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
configuration.
It sets allowed origins, headers, methods, and max age for CORS requests, and registers this configuration with a
UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource object.

```java
    public CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource() {
    var corsConfiguration = new CorsConfiguration();
    corsConfiguration.setAllowCredentials(true);
    corsConfiguration.setAllowedOrigins(List.of("http://-.com", "http://localhost:4200", "http://localhost:3000"));
    corsConfiguration.setAllowedHeaders(Arrays.asList(ORIGIN, ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN, CONTENT_TYPE, ACCEPT, AUTHORIZATION, X_REQUESTED_WITH, ACCESS_CONTROL_REQUEST_METHOD, ACCESS_CONTROL_REQUEST_HEADERS, ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS, FILE_NAME));
    corsConfiguration.setExposedHeaders(Arrays.asList(ORIGIN, ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN, CONTENT_TYPE, ACCEPT, AUTHORIZATION, X_REQUESTED_WITH, ACCESS_CONTROL_REQUEST_METHOD, ACCESS_CONTROL_REQUEST_HEADERS, ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS, FILE_NAME));
    corsConfiguration.setAllowedMethods(Arrays.asList(GET.name(), POST.name(), PUT.name(), PATCH.name(), DELETE.name(), OPTIONS.name()));
    corsConfiguration.setMaxAge(3600L);
    var source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
    source.registerCorsConfiguration(BASE_PATH, corsConfiguration);
    return source;
}
```

# Mutifactor Authentication

So far we have been able to register a user and also login the user, we've encountred quite a few error along the way,
like the user not found error, confirmation not found error, role not found error and also credential not found error.
Most of these error a linked to the repo class, and due to some variabnles spelt wrong. In other to solce these error i
used
a basic debugging skill like printing out each line and tracing the not found error, it was quiter useful but the
downside is the
time taken.

So now what we are going to work on is, the MFA, allowin users to set multifactor authentication, and enabling their
multifactor authentication, so thats what we are going to do.

So the first thing we did was create the endpoints that are going to be responsible for the MFA,
The setupMfa endopoint, for creating MFA for the user and the Cancel endpoint for cancelling endpoint.

```java

@PatchMapping("/mfa/setup")
public ResponseEntity<Response> setupMfa(@AuthenticationPrincipal User userPrincipal, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var user = userService.setUpMfa(userPrincipal.getId()); //Set up mfa for each specific id
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("user", user), "Mfa set up successfully", OK));
}
```

```java

@PatchMapping("/mfa/cancel")
public ResponseEntity<Response> cancelMfa(@AuthenticationPrincipal User userPrincipal, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var user = userService.cancelMfa(userPrincipal.getId());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("user", user), "User MFA cancel successfully", OK));
}
```

In the both endpoint we created two helper method, the setupMfa method and the canclMfa method,
this method will define the logic for both methods, so what we are going to be working on next is putting
an implementation for this method.

# QR Code Utils

Today we will be working on the QR code utils, so we creat a method and two helper method,qrcodeimageuri this method
help to create qrcode uri, then we defined
an helper method qrDataFunction, this helper method will help in the creation of the qr data, which will then be used in
the imageuri method to generate the data for the QR code.

After we then defined a methood called qr code secret, this method helps basically to generate the qr code secret.
So overall, we have a way to get the secret to the qrcode, we have a way to get the QRcodeImageUri and we also have a
way to get the data that will be passed to the imageUri, the data we generate is when we use in creating the uri.

So what we are going to do next is give an implementation for the method, setUpMfa and cancelMfa making use of the utils
method just created.

# Multifactor Authentication 2

The setupMfa method is takes in parameter Long, then it first retrived the userEntity object associated with the give
id,
using the getUserEntityById Method, then it retrieved a secret code using the qrCodeSecret.get method, more about the
mentioned method can be found in the QR Code util section.

Next, it sets the qrCodeImageUri and qrCodeSecret properties of the userEntity object with the retrieved values.
it also sets the mfa property to true.

After that, it saves the updated userEntity object in the repository using userRepository.save(userEntity).
Finally it then return a User object created by calling the fromUserEntity method with the userEntity.

Similar this was also done for the CancelMfa, we get the userEntity asscoaited with the id of the user, then we
set the mfa to false and then the qrcode and the qrcode secret to empty, then we save the userEntity to the database,
this will delete the mfa record in the database.

After we tested the setupMfa endpoint and also the cancelMfa endpoint, by providing the user login details, and
we were able to get a qrcodeimageUri for the user and also send the MFA to true, so after we then copy the
qrcodeimageuri
and pasted in into the browser which then displayed the QR image.
![img_19.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_19.png)
![img_20.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_20.png)
![img_21.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_21.png)
We futher confirmed the QR code image by scanning the QR code with Google Authenticator app, which then generates
a code.
![img_18.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Fimg_18.png)

The next thing we going to be working on is verifying the QR code.

## QR Verification

Notes - make sure to add the doc explanation
We created a `verfiyQrCode` methood in the `UserService` then implemented the method, the method takes in a userID and
also
a `QRcode`, because we want to get the userEntity we had to create a new `getUserEntityByUserId` method, which we use in
geting
the userId.

```java
    public User verifyQrCode(String userId, String qrCode) {
    var userEntity = getUserEntityByUserId(userId);
    verifyCode(qrCode, userEntity.getQrCodeSecret());
    return fromUserEntity(userEntity, userEntity.getRole(), getUserCredentialById(userEntity.getId());
}
```

```java
    private UserEntity getUserEntityByUserId(String userId) {
    var userByUserId = userRepository.findUserByUserId(userId);
    return userByUserId.orElseThrow(() -> new ApiException("User not found for qr verification"))
}
```

This method get the userId xssciate with the user from the database, then after created a new helper method called
`verifyCode` this method is a boolean method, that takes in a qrCode and a qrCodeSecret, this method makes use of the
TimeProvider, CodeGenerator and the CodeVerifier method, this method use the codeVerifier to verify the generatedCode
and the timeProvider, then it check if the qrCodeSecrrt and the QrCode are valid, if they are it returns true and vice
versal.

```java
 private boolean verifyCode(String qrCode, String qrCodeSecret) {
    TimeProvider timeProvider = new SystemTimeProvider();
    CodeGenerator codeGenerator = new DefaultCodeGenerator();
    CodeVerifier codeVerifier = new DefaultCodeVerifier(codeGenerator, timeProvider);
    if (codeVerifier.isValidCode(qrCodeSecret, qrCode)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        throw new ApiException("Invalid QR code. Please try again")
    }
}
```

Now we are ready to verfiy the QR code whenever we send a request to the verfyQrCode method endpoints, kso what we are
going to do
now is test these all the methodhiy resposible for the MFA.
> Make sure to update this part with screenshots and steps if possible.

# Testing

Encounter an error when i tired to loginn the user, i entered the wrong password and tried to login the
user and it still gave the user and login in the user.

- Need to fix issue with logining wrong user.

Next i tested the email by entering the wronmg emial and that seems to work fine, no error so far, so i think the issue
is just with the
credentials, so i need to debug where the issue comes from.
![testingCredentials.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FtestingCredentials.png)

My thought are the issue has something to do with the authenticate method, i purposely bypass a pevious issue
i was having with the user credential by reversing the logic of the if condition that checks if the encoded password
matches the
password from the database, if it matches the password then the user should be authenticated and if it doesnt match the
password
it should throw an api exception error." If i fix the issue that should resolve it.

```java
  if(!encoder.matches(apiAuthentication.getPassword(),userCredential.
getPassword())){
    System.out.
println("Password dont match"+apiAuthentication.getPassword() +" "+userCredential.
getPassword());
    return ApiAuthentication.
authenticated(user, userPrincipal.getAuthorities());
    }else throw new
ApiException("Bad Credentials(Email and /or password incorrect. Please try again");
        }throw new
ApiException("Unable to authenticate user");
```

so until this error is solved, we cant test to bruteforce implementation we had, which is basically when a user enters
the wrong
passoword for the 5th time, it should lock the account of the user.

For now we will move forward with the next usecaases which is the RESET PASSWORD, and then come back to that later.

# RESET PASSWORD

```markdown
# Reset password

1. The application should allow users to reset their password
2. The application should send a link to the user 'email' to reset their password (link to be invalid after being click
   on).
3. The application should present a screen with a form to reset the password when the linked is clicked. (FRONTEND)
4. If the password has been reset successfully, user should be able to login using the new created password
5. The application should allow user to reset their password anytime they want as manay time as possible.
```

All of this is when the user is not logged in, they can reset only when they are not logged in.
So this is how the reset password method work, we are going to take in a request for the resetpasword

```java
 @PostMapping("/resetpassword")
```

This request is going to accept an email and the http request body and then we are going to pass this to the
resetpassword method then we return the response which will be the 200 OK response.

```java

@PostMapping("/resetpassword")
public ResponseEntity<Response> resetPassword(@RequestBody @Valid EmailUserResetPasswordRequest emailRequest, HttpServletRequest request) {
    userService.resetPassword(emailRequest.getEmail());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, emptyMap(), "Kindly check your email for the link to reset your password", OK));
}
```

So now we are going to be working on implementing the reset password method, the method resetPassword takes in a email,
then get the userEntity associated with the
email, after it then try to get the confirmation for the user, if the user confirmation exist it then send the email to
the user, if the user confirmation did not exist it
create a new confirmation for the user, then save the new one to the database and forward the email to the user.

```java

@Override
public void resetPassword(String email) {
    //Lets get the user
    var user = getUserEntityByEmail(email);
    //Let get the user confirmation
    var confirmation = getUserConfirmation(user);
    if (confirmation != null) {
        //Send existing confirmation
        publisher.publishEvent(new UserEvent(user, RESETPASSWORD, Map.of("key", confirmation.getKey())));
    } else {
        // Create new confirmation, save and send
        var confirmationEntity = new ConfirmationEntity(user);
        System.out.println("Confirmation Entity for ResetPassword -------------: " + confirmationEntity);
        confirmationRepository.save(confirmationEntity);
        publisher.publishEvent(new UserEvent(user, RESETPASSWORD, Map.of("key", confirmationEntity.getKey())));
    }
}
```

So after the implementamtion of this method we just tested the endpoint and all is woking fine.
![resetEmailTestingAPI.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FresetEmailTestingAPI.png)
![emailtesting.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2Femailtesting.png).

# Verify Reset Password

### Endpoint

So the next thing we want to work on is the actiavtion of the link send to the email so user can enter a new password,
we created a
new endpoint `verifyResetPassword` this method handles the POST request to the verifypassword endpoints, it also
expected a
query parameter with name "key" this key is a uuid generated, the method then calls thee verifyPasswordkey method in the
userservices, which is yet to be implementedm, passing the value of the key param. If the verification is successful
thema response 200 OK status
is given and then a response body containing a massage that prompt user to enter a new password, the response body also
incliude a user obnject.

```java

@PostMapping("/verify/password")
public ResponseEntity<Response> verifyResetPassword(@RequestParam("key") String key, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var user = userService.verifyPasswordKey(key);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, of("user", user), "Kindly enter a new password", OK));
} 
```

So the next thing we want to work on is the implementantion of the `verifyPasswordKey` method.

### Implementation

The `verifyPasswordKey` takes in a key as parmeter, the method first tires to find the `confirmationEntity` by passing
it the key
then, it checks if the key exist or not, if the key is not found meaning of its null , it throws an Apiexception error,
if the key
is found it then tires to get the userEntity by passing it the email.
An addtional conditon for when the userEntity is not found, if its not found then that means the key passes is incorrect
so it throws
a new api exception error, however if the userEntity is found it then `verifyAccontStatus`, which is a method that
checks if the user
account is enable, locked and expired.

```java
    public static void verifyAccountStatus(UserEntity user) {
    if (!user.isEnabled()) {
        throw new ApiException("User Account is disable, unable to verify ResetPassword cannot be verified");
    }
    if (!user.isAccountNonExpired()) {
        throw new ApiException("User Account is Expired, unable to verify ResetPassword");
    }
    if (!user.isAccountNonLocked()) {
        throw new ApiException("User Account is Locked, unable to verify ResetPassword");
    }
```

After it verify's the account status of the user, it then delete the confirmationEntity from the database and returns a
User Object.

```java

@Override
public User verifyPasswordKey(String key) {
    // Find the confirmation entity in the database, it confirmation not found
    var confirmationEntity = getUserConfirmation(key);
    if (confirmationEntity == null) {
        throw new ApiException("Unable to find the token (key) for confirmation");
    }
    // If the confirmation is found
    var userEntity = getUserEntityByEmail(confirmationEntity.getUserEntity().getEmail());
    // If userEntity not found
    if (userEntity == null) {
        throw new ApiException("Incorrect token)key");
    }
    verifyAccountStatus(userEntity);
    confirmationRepository.delete(confirmationEntity);
    return fromUserEntity(userEntity, userEntity.getRole(), getUserCredentialById(userEntity.getId()));
}
```

![verifyAccountReset.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FverifyAccountReset.png)

So now what we have to do next is to allow users to change their password, for now that can only enter request to change
passsword,
enter a new password when verified but now we need them to be able to change their password, that is what we are goign
to be working

# Activate user password reset

We created a new endpoint to handle the request when a user enter their new password and tries to reset their password,
this
method handles a POST request to the endpoint, it takes in a `resetPasswordRequest` dto object as a request body, it
then validates it and
then use the `updatePassword` method to update the user's password.
Finally it return the status code 200 and then a response body containing a success message.

```java

@PostMapping("/resetpassword/reset")
public ResponseEntity<Response> activateResetPassword(@RequestBody @Valid ResetPasswordRequest resetPasswordRequest, HttpServletRequest request) {
    userService.updatePassword(resetPasswordRequest.getUserId(), resetPasswordRequest.getNewPassword(), resetPasswordRequest.getConfirmNewPassword());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, emptyMap(), "User password reset successful", OK));
}
```

so now we will work on the updatePassword method.

## Implement updatePassword method

The method updatePassword takes in a userId, newPassword and confirm new password, the reason we have a userId is
because the users
are currently not logged in so in other to reset their password we need to have their id, so when the user enter a new
password
and then enter the confirm new password, the method checks if both password matches

```java
   public void updatePassword(String userId, String newPassword, String confirmNewPassword) {
    if (!confirmNewPassword.equals(newPassword)) {
        throw new ApiException("Password don't match. Please try again");
    }
    //..................
```

if they dont it throws a new ApiException message saying password dont match and when they match it gets the user by
user id then it set the new password to the credential and encode the password
then it saves the credential to the databse.

```java
 var user = getUserByUserId(userId);
var credentials = getUserCredentialById(user.getId());
        credentials.
setPassword(encoder.encode(newPassword));
credentialR
```

# User Profile Feature

```markdown
# Profile

1. Application should allow users to update their basic profile
2. Application should allow users to update their password while they are logged in
3. Application should allow users to update their account settings while they are loffed in
4. Application should allow users to update their profile while they are logged in
```

These are what we will be working on, we want to make sure we allow the user to see their information, as of now, we
dont
have anyway to allow users to see their information or to show te show the profile of the user.

We created an endpoint called profile, this endpoint is responsible for providing the neccessary user profile data
basically,
the userEntity, it has a method `profile` annotated with `AuthenticatedPrincipal` and takes in a UserPrincipal and Htttp
Request.. The reason why we used the Authenticated Principle annotation is because this is an authenticated routes, user
has to be authenticated before they can be allowed to view their profile.

Then we created get the userId from the userPrincipal and return a response body with a user object and a message "User
profile has been retrived".

```java

@GetMapping("/profile")
public ResponseEntity<Response> profile(@AuthenticationPrincipal User userPrincipal, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var user = userService.getUserByUserId(userPrincipal.getUserId());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, of("user", user), "User Profile Retrieved", OK));
}
```

![userProfileApi.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FuserProfileApi.png)
So now we have a way to get the user, the other thing we have to do now, is that we have to allow them to update this
information so thats why we are going to be working on.

# Update user Profile

We created a endpoints called `update` this endpoint is responsible for updating neccessary user profile details, like
the
first name, last name, email, bio and phone number, this endpoint is annotated with the `@AuthenticationPrincipal` and
`@RequestBody` becuase the user has to be authenticated before they can update their profile and also because its a
`PatchMapping` we need to get the user data from the UserRequest.
Then we created a method `updateUser`, this method takes in a userId, and some data from the userRequest like the
firstname,
lastname, email, bio and phone. Then return a responsebody of a user Object and a message.

```java

@PatchMapping("/update")
public ResponseEntity<Response> update(@AuthenticationPrincipal User userPrincipal, @RequestBody UserRequest userRequest, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var user = userService.updateUser(userPrincipal.getUserId(), userRequest.getFirstName(), userRequest.getLastName(), userRequest.getEmail(), userRequest.getPassword(), userRequest.getBio());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, of("user", user), "User updated Successfully", OK));
}
```

So what we are going to be working on now is the `updateUser` method in the userServices.

### Update User impl

In the method. the main thing we want to do is find the user and also update the user information.
The method takes in a userId (only when the user log in), firstname, lastname, email, phone and bio beause these are the
things we want to be chaning in the application, then we get the user Entity with the userId of the user when logged in,
after
we set the data that needs to be updated, save it to the database and return a user object including the updated data.

```java

@Override
public User updateUser(String userId, String firstName, String lastName, String email, String phone, String bio) {
    var userEntity = getUserEntityByUserId(userId); // UserId is coming from the logged-in user
    userEntity.setFirstName(firstName);
    userEntity.setLastName(lastName);
    userEntity.setEmail(email);
    userEntity.setPhone(phone);
    userEntity.setBio(bio);
    userRepository.save(userEntity);
    return fromUserEntity(userEntity, userEntity.getRole(), getUserCredentialById(userEntity.getId()));
}
```

#### Testing update endpoints

1. First login
2. Hit the endpoints!

> For testing purpose make sure to disable MFA
![updateEndpointApi.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FupdateEndpointApi.png)

So now user can chage the basic information on their profile, next we need to allow them to change the advance setting
like their roles and setting on account.

# Update Advance User Settings ( ROLES AND ACCOUNT SETTINGS)

So we created an endpoint called the updaterole, responsible for updating the user roles, similar to the update endpoint
it takes in the authenticated user, which mean if the user is not logged in or authenticated, the user cannot update,
also takes in the role request and httpservlet request.
Then we created a method called updateRole, which was the implemented in the user services, this method takes in the
userID
of the authenticated userRole.

```java
    void updateRole(String userId, String role);
```

We get the userEntity then we set the role to the user entity and save the userEntity to the database.

```java

@Override
public void updateRole(String userId, String role) {
    var userEntity = getUserEntityByUserId(userId);
    userEntity.setRole(getRoleName(role));
    userRepository.save(userEntity);
}
```

![userRoleupdate.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FuserRoleupdate.png)
![userroleUpdate2.png](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fassets%2FuserroleUpdate2.png)

So what we want to work on next is makig user able to update their settings like the `accountLocked`, `accountExpied`,
`accountEnable` and `CredentialExpired`.
So we created two endpoints for each of them:

1. toggleCredentialsExpired: This endpoints takes in the authenticated User and Http request, it has a
   toggleCredentialsExpired
   method that takes in a UserId, this method is responsible for making user account expire, in case the admin or
   manager want to
   make a user account expire it can be toggled on and off. The toggleCredentialsExpired created a userEnitty and also a
   credentialEntity,
   if then checks if the credentials of the user is more than 90 days, if it is more than 90 days it updates the
   credentials
   and if its not not more than 90 days it set the user credentials to more than 90 days, which means the user account
   is
   expired.
2. toggleAccountEnabled: This method also takes in a userId as param, then it created a userEntity set the user account
   enable to false, if the user is enabled and viseversal. Then save the userEntity to the database
3. toggleAccountExpired: Thus method takes in a userId as param, it then creates a userEntity by usging the
   getUserByUserId
   method to get the userEntity by Id. Then it set the accountNonExpired to false and vise versal after it saved the
   userEntity
   to the database.
4. toggleAccountLocked : Similar process for the toggleAccountLocked method.

# User logged in passsword update.

So the next thing we want to do is an implementation that is going yo allow the user to update their password,
when they are logged in.

We created a new endpoint called the updatePassword, this method takes in a the Authenticated User, becuase the user has
to be
logged in before they can make an atmpt to chage their password in the settings, then it also takes in a `@RequesBody`
`updateUserPasswordRequest` this request has the password(currentPassword, newPassword and confirmNewPasssword). Then we
created
a new helper method in the userServices called the updatePassword, this method updatePassword is similar to the
`updatePassword`
method used for when not logged in user what to reset their password. However this latest update password, takes in
different
parameters from the not logged in update password.

So the `updatePassword` method first checks if the `confirnNewPassword` is similar to the newPassword, it is not similar
it throw an api exception error with a message.

```java
if(!confirmNewPassword.equals(newPassword)){throw new
ApiException("New currentPassword don't match"); }
```

Then we get a new `userEntity` by passing in the `UserId` of the user requesting to update their password, then we
verify
the user with the `verifyAccountStatus` method to check if the user is allowed to make an update on their account.
If true, then we get the user credentials by passing in the userId, gotten from the userEnity and then, this gives us
the
user current password which we then compare with the newPassword provided by the user, if the `currentPassword` provided
by the user is not equal to the password from the database(which belongs to the user) then we throw an api exception,
if otherwise we then endcode the newPasword save it to the database replacing the old password.

```java
var user = getUserEntityByUserId(userId);
verifyAccountStatus(user);
var credentials = getUserCredentialById(user.getId());
        if(!encoder.
matches(currentPassword, credentials.getPassword())){throw new
ApiException(" Existing currentPassword is incorrect, Kindly try again"); }
    credentials.
setPassword(encoder.encode(newPassword));
    credentialRepository.
save(credentials);
```

Then we run test on the endpoint and it went well.

## Updating User Profile

What we first did was create an enpoint called `/photo` this endpoint is responsible for handling the user photo upload,
and it uses a PatchMapping annotation. Then we created the method uploadPhoto responsible for handling Patch request to
the /photo endpoints.
The endpoint is a protected route so the method takes in a an authenticated user, so the user has to be logged in before
that can change their profile so the method takes in an Authenticated `User`, MultipartFile which is the file the user
is uploading and HttpServletRequest.

Then we created an upload photo method in the userservice this method is responsible for uploading the photo, it takes
in
a userId and a file.

```java

@PatchMapping("/photo")
public ResponseEntity<Response> uploadPhoto(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, @RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file, HttpServletRequest request) {
    // In this case we are not returning a user, we are only updating the roles of the users
    var imageUrl = userService.uploadPhoto(user.getUserId(), file);
```

Then it returns a responseEnity OK and a body containining the imageUrl and a success message.

```java
...
    return ResponseEntity.ok().
body(getResponse(request, of("imageUrl", imageUrl), "Profile Photo Update Successfully",OK));
    }
```

The uploadPhoto Method takes in a userId and a MultipartFile file, then we creates a userEntity and a photoFunction
method.
Then we set the imageUrl passing in the photoUrl and append a timestamp to the photoUrl to ensure that the url is
different
everytime the image is updated, this is done so that when the browser featch the image everytime the sources attribute
will
be different and then save the user object to the database and return thr photoUrl.

```java

@Override
public String uploadPhoto(String userId, MultipartFile file) {
    //Get the user entity
    var user = getUserEntityByUserId(userId);
    //Create helper method
    var photoUrl = photoFunction.apply(userId, file);
        /* Make sure the url is diff everytime its updated so the will not refetch the image
        The reason we want to change the url everytime is because
        we want the browser to fetch the image everytime the sources attribute is different
         */
    user.setImageUrl(photoUrl + "?timestamp=" + System.currentTimeMillis());
    userRepository.save(user);
    return photoUrl;
}
```

The photoFunction called by the uploadPhoto method takes in two param, a string Id and a MultipartFile file.
The Function create a filename with the `uuid` and a concat "png"

```java
 private final BiFunction<String, MultipartFile, String> photoFunction = (id, file) -> {
    var filename = id + "png";
```

Then we create a file Storage location in the user's home diretory in the Downloads folder, it create a new folder
called uploads, if the in happends that the directory does not exist it will create a new one and then copy the content
of the file which will be an image to a specific location.
Finally it creaTED a URI String using the current context path and the filename and rhen return it. If an error occurs
during the process, it thows an ApiException message "Unable to find Image".

```java
 try{
var fileStorageLocation = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home") + "/Downloads/uploads").toAbsolutePath().normalize();
            if(!Files.
exists(fileStorageLocation)){
    Files.
createDirectories(fileStorageLocation); }
    Files.
copy(file.getInputStream(),fileStorageLocation.
resolve(filename),REPLACE_EXISTING);
    return ServletUriComponentsBuilder
    .
fromCurrentContextPath()
                    .
path("/user/image/"+filename).
toUriString();
        }catch(
Exception exception){
    throw new
ApiException("Unable to save image");
        }
            };
```

New we need to create a get request so that we can see the image when the imageUrl is clicked.
So the next thing we have next is to implement the lgout functionality.

## Logout

So for the logout feature, we created a logout endpoint, it had a method `logout` that handler the logout request, this
method
takes in the Httpservelet Request, response and Authentication, the reason why we use authentication and not the
authenticated principal is because we need some other things in the authentication, AuthenticationPrincipal and
Authentication
are kind of the samething, the authentication is what we have as the authenticate entity for the request in the current
thread.
After we created a ApiLogoutHandler class in the handler package and inject it into the field, this `ApilogoutHandle`
handles
the logout, it has a method called logout that takes in the request,response and Authentication, then create a
logoutHandler
object using the SecurityContextLogoutHandler. Then passes in the response,request and authentication.

```java

@Override
public void logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Authentication authentication) {
    //SecurityContextLogoutHandler logoutHandler = new SecurityContextLogoutHandler();
    var logoutHandler = new SecurityContextLogoutHandler();
    logoutHandler.logout(request, response, authentication);
```

Then we uses the JwtServices.removeCookie method to remove the cookies from the request.

```java
      // We need to remove the cookie
        jwtService.removeCookie(request, response, ACCESS.getValue());
    jwtService.
removeCookie(request, response, REFRESH.getValue());
```

## Document Management (List and Details).

### Document Entity

So the first thing we did was check the schema for the document entity and made sure that its in the corrent form,
before
we move on to creating the entity for the document using the schema as a refernce, because this helps avoid making
mistake, as
JPA will the managing the entity for us and we want to make sure that the name are in the right other so we wont have
any
issue going forward or JPA wont have issue finding the data we need.

Then we created a new class called the DocumentEntity, this class has the following fields and are related to the schema
created for the docuemnt entity.

```java
public class DocumentEntity extends Auditable {
    @Column(updatable = false, unique = true, nullable = false) // We cannot have a user without an id
    private String documentId;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private String uri;
    private Long size;
    private String formattedSize; // Human-readable representation of size.
    private String icon;
    private String extension;
```

As you can see we also extend Auditable for the docuemnt entity this is because we need to know which docuemnt belongs
to
which user., so we need the `id` of the user entity.
We also make use of the following annotations, which are pretty similar to the other entity classes.

```java
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@Builder //Need to know what this is for
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "documents") //Naming the table
@JsonInclude(NON_DEFAULT)
```

After that we then created a private field of the usewr entity, this field serves as the owner of the document, so every
document it associaoted with the owner.
So we map the docuemnt with the annotation `@ManyToOne` this means that many document could belong to more users and
also
the `@JoinColumn` annotation where we created a new column in the DocumentEntity called the user_id this could then
reference the column named `id` in the User Table and its also a foreignKey in the document table.
So basically, the `id` in the user table will be the `user_Id`(owner) in the document table.

So the next thing we are going to work on next is create a repository so that we can interact with the document entity
and the database.

# Document Repository.

### Working with both SQL and JPA

In these repository we are going to be working with sql and Jpa at the same time becuase we are going to be returning a
page of document. JPA has pagination that we can use but we dont want to re-create the wheel.

So we are passing in the `@Query` annotation because we do not want to just get the document, we want to get the
docuemnt owner..and some
other data related to the document and also other table like the user table, because we need to get the user name and
some
some other things so that will also require us to do a join table of the document and the user table.

```java

@Query(countQuery = "SELECT COUNT(*)FROM documents", value = "", nativeQuery = true)
Page<DocumentEntity> findDocument(Pageable pageable);
```

So with this query what we are basically sayng is, i need to get a page but i need to wrote my own query for what i want
this page to contain.
If you every want to get pages of data so that you can still use the pageable api, then you need to add the count query
in your @Query annotation becuase JPA needs that information to do the paging.

So the next thing we did was create the query mto fetch the document information that will be returned in the pageable
api,
we want to get the owner information alongside the document data, for us to do that we have to concat the owner
`firstName`
and `lastName` and also concat the person that updated the document which will be the updater.

For the owner and the updated we simply used the ownerId which is the createdBy of the document and for the updater we
use the updatedBy of the document.
Here is the query used -

```postgresql
SELECT doc.id,
       doc.document_id,
       doc.name,
       doc.description,
       doc.uri,
       doc.icon,
       doc.size,
       doc.formatted_size,
       doc.extension,
       doc.reference_id,
       doc.created_at,
       doc.updated_at,
       CONCAT(owner.first_name, ' ', owner.last_name)     AS owner_name,
       owner.email                                        AS owner_email,
       owner.phone                                        AS owner_phone,
       owner.last_login                                   AS owner_last_login,
       CONCAT(updater.first_name, ' ', updater.last_name) AS updater_name
FROM documents doc
         JOIN users owner ON owner.id = doc.created_by
         JOIN users updater ON updater.id = doc.updated_by
```

The information we are going to get when we run these query is not going to match the document entity we have

```java
 Page<DocumentEntity> findDocument(Pageable pageable);
```

These is because we dont have all the owner name, owner.email and owner.phone number also the updater so what we need to
do and what we will do now is create a different class to represent the data this query is going to return, so thats
what
we will be working on next.

# Repository 2

So we created a new package in the DTO packages called `api` and inside this `api` package we created a new interface
class,
called the `IDocument` this class is responsible for the representing the data that the Query in the Document Repository
class is going to return.
If we dont have this class as an interface this @Query annotation is not going to work and it also has to be struture in
a specific
way for it to work.

So what we need to do is give a getter and a setter for every column we have in the document table so every data that
exist
in this interface need to have a getter and a setter.
By doing it these way, JPA is going to do the mapping for us and also give us the pageable and thats how we are going to
be working with both sql and JPA at the same time.

```java
public interface IDocument {

    Long getId();
    void setId(Long id);
    String getDocument_Id();
    void setDocument_Id(String documentId);
    String getName();
    void setName(String name);
    String getDescription();
    void setDescription(String description);
    String getUri();
    void setUri(String uri);
    String getIcon();
    void setIcon(String icon);
    long getSize();
    void setSize(long size);
    @JsonProperty("formattedSize")
    String getFormatted_Size();
    void setFormatted_Size(String formattedSize);
    String getExtension();
    void setExtension(String extension);
    @JsonProperty("referenceId")
    String getReference_Id();
    void setReference_Id(String referenceId);
    @JsonProperty("createdAt")
    LocalDateTime getCreated_At();
    void setCreated_At(LocalDateTime createdAt);
    @JsonProperty("updatedAt")
    LocalDateTime getUpdated_At();
    void setUpdated_At(LocalDateTime updatedAt);
    @JsonProperty("ownerName")
    String getOwner_Name();
    void setOwner_Name(String ownerName);
    @JsonProperty("ownerEmail")
    String getOwner_Email();
    void setOwner_Email(String ownerEmail);
    @JsonProperty("ownerPhone")
    String getOwner_Phone();
    void setOwner_Phone(String ownerPhone);
    @JsonProperty("ownerLastLogin")
    String getOwner_Last_Login();
    void setOwner_Last_Login(String ownerLastLogin);
    @JsonProperty("updaterName")
    String getUpdater_Name();
    void setUpdater_Name(String updaterName);
}
```

This fomat is a very sensitive format that i have to following so that spring JPA can do the mapping for us and also the
pagination at the same tim, that way we dont get away from using the pagination that is very good in JPA and at the same
time our query so that we can effecrively query our database.

So this way we are still using pageable which is very good by the way and at the same time, we can write own own query
to
return what ever we want in the page of data so instead of using the Document Entity we just pass in the IDocument.

```java

@Query(countQuery = SELECT_COUNT_DOCUMENT_QUERY, value = SELECT_DOCUMENT_QUERY, nativeQuery = true)
Page<IDocument> findDocument(Pageable pageable);
```

The reason we used the @JsonProperty annotation is becuase whenever we are desrilising it and we dont want it to give us
the `_`. For example let say we want the `getDocument_id`, we are going the get the same `getDocument_ID` format instead
of the
`documentId` format so by using `JsonProperty` we get just the `docuementId`. So we basically use the JsonProperty to
reformat it.

So what we want to do next is create the controller and then create the services.

## Document Services

We created a new interface class called the `DocumentService` this interface contains all the method for the docuemnt
entities,
like the `getDocuments`, `saveDocuments`, basically all the CRUD Operations for the Documents.

```java
    Page<IDocument> getDocuments(int page, int size); // For getting the document
Page<IDocument> getDocuments(int page, int size, String name); // For searching the document.
Collection<IDocument> saveDocuments(String userId, List<MultipartFile> documents); // For all the document we want to save.
// Returning a document object
IDocument updateDocument(String documentId, String name, String description);
IDocument getDocumentByDocumentId(String documentId);
void deleteDocument(String documentId);
Resource getResource(String documentName);
```

- The getDocuments (1) is returing a page of documents, while the getDocuments (2) is for searching for documents by
  name.
- SaveDocument is for saving a list of document we want to save
- UpdateDocument is for updating any documents
- GetDocumentsByDocumentId is for getting specific documents by their Id.
  Both Update and Getting Documents by Id are returning an Object of Documents(IDocuments).
- deleteDocument for deleting documents
- getResources is for getting any documents by the name of the documents.

So what we are going to work on next is implementing these methods in the DocumentServicsImpl class what we are going to
be creating next.

## Document Services Implementation

So we created a new class called the `DocumentServiceImpl` this class will contains the implementation of the document
interface class so the fist thing we did was implement all the methods and then worked on the `getDocuments` method.

This method takes in a page and a size as param, then we return a page of document contains `page`, `size` and and also
sort
the documents by `name`.

```java

@Override
public Page<IDocument> getDocuments(int page, int size) {
    return documentRepository.findDocument(PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("name")));
}
```

Now that we have a way to get the document we need to find a way to saveDocument because we dont have any document in
our
database so we cant get any yet. Thats what we will be working on next.

## Document Service Implementationm 2 (Save Document)

### Document DTO creation.

First we created a Document class in the DTO package, this is going to represrent the document class that we are sending
to the frontend we cannot use the IDocument because that is for interacting with the database. It's basically the
representation
of the document we are going to be working with on the client side.

So now we will be working on saving the document metadata in the database and also save the document in the server, so
that
what we are going to be working on next.

### Creating document metadata

In the `saveDocument` method we first created a list of new documents(ArrayList), then we created a new userEntity
because
we need the userEntity of the user trying to save to a document entity.

```java
  public Collection<Document> saveDocuments(String userId, List<MultipartFile> documents) {
    List<Document> newDocuments = new ArrayList<>();
    var userEntity = userRepository.findUserByUserId(userId).get();
    var storage = Paths.get(FILE_STORAGE).toAbsolutePath().normalize();
```

Then we also created a new file-storage this serves as the absolutePath for the document storage.

```java
try{
    // For every document in thr documents
    for(MultipartFile document :documents){
var filename = cleanPath(Objects.requireNonNull(document.getOriginalFilename()));
                if("..".
contains(filename)){
    throw new
ApiException(String.format(("Invalid file name: %s", filename)));
var documentEntity = DocumentEntity
    .builder()
    .documentId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
    .name(filename)
    .owner(userEntity)
    .extension(getExtension(filename))
    .uri(getDocumentUri(filename))
    .formattedSize(byteCountToDisplaySize(document.getSize()))
    .icon(setIcon((getExtension(filename))))
    .build();
                }
                    }
                    }catch(
Exception exception){}
    return null;
    }
```

After that we create a try and catch, inside this try and catch we loop through each document in the documents, get the
original file name of the document and also check if the document filename contains the special character `..`.
If it does we throw new api exc*e*ption `Invalid file name` and if it does we then created the documentEntity.

The documentEntity was created using the builder annotation, in the object we added the follwowing@

- documentId - this is a UUID generated randomly
- filename - document filename
- owner - this is the userEntity of the created documents.
- extensions - this is the original extension of the document.
- uri - for the uri we created a new method called the `getDocumentUri` this was created in the util package, this
  method
  takes in a filename as param and then return a string of URI, this methid uses a `servletUriComponentsBuilder` to
  build the
  URI string.

```java
public class DocumentUtils {
    public static String getDocumentUri(String filename) {
        return ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentContextPath().path(String.format("/documents/%s", filename)).toUriString();
    }
```

- formattedSize - this is file size of the document formatted into string.
- icons - we created a method called `setIcons` in the documentUtil, this method takes in a fileExtensions, it uses
  `stringUtils` to `trimAllWhiteSpace` from the fileExtension.
  Then it check if the fileExtension contains some common document file extensions like "DOC, DOCX, XSL, XLSX AND PDF"
  for each
  extension an icon is returned and then if the extension does not contain any of the mentions extension we set in a
  default
  icon which is the DOC icon.

```java
public class DocumentUtils {
    public static String setIcon(String fileExtension) {
        String extension = StringUtils.trimAllWhitespace(fileExtension);
        if (extension.equalsIgnoreCase("DOC") || extension.equalsIgnoreCase("DOCX")) {
            return "https://htmlstream.com/preview/front-dashboard-v2.1.1/assets/svg/brands/word-icon.svg";
        }
        if (extension.equalsIgnoreCase("XLS") || extension.equalsIgnoreCase("XLSX")) {
            return "https://htmlstream.com/preview/front-dashboard-v2.1.1/assets/svg/brands/excel-icon.svg"
        }
        if (extension.equalsIgnoreCase("PDF")) {
            return "https://htmlstream.com/preview/front-dashboard-v2.1.1/assets/svg/brands/pdf-icon.svg"
        } else {
            return "https://htmlstream.com/preview/front-dashboard-v2.1.1/assets/svg/brands/word-icon.svg";
        }
    }
```

Then we build the document.

### Saving Document

In additon to the `saveDocument` method after building the document we then save the document to the database using the
`documentRepository`. This only save the document to the database but we also want to save this document to the file
system
in our provided path.

```java
var savedDocument = documentRepository.save(documentEntity);
Files.
copy(document.getInputStream(),storage.
resolve(filename),REPLACE_EXISTING);
```

After we then generate newDocument using the `fromDocumentEntity` method, this was created in the userUtils, this method
takes in the `documentEntity`, `User` which is the used is created and updated the document as parameter.
In the `fromDocumentEntity` we created a new each time we call it. Then we copy the properrties of the documentEntity
into
the newly created document, this save us the time of having to created each properties. After that we then created the
properties
that doesnt exist in the documentEntities like the `Owner` -> name,email,phone_number, lastLogin, updaterName.
After creating the document and adding the properties we then return the documents.

```java
public class DocumentUtils {
    public static Document fromDocumentEntity(DocumentEntity documentEntity, User createdBy, User updatedBy) {
        var document = new Document();
        // Copy all the document properties from documentEntity into the document.
        BeanUtils.copyProperties(documentEntity, document);
        document.setOwnerName(createdBy.getFirstName() + " " + createdBy.getLastName());
        document.setOwnerEmail(createdBy.getEmail());
        document.setOwnerPhone(createdBy.getPhone());
        document.setOwnerLastLogin(createdBy.getLastLogin());
        document.setUpdaterName(createdBy.getFirstName() + " " + createdBy.getLastName());
        return document;
    }
```

Finally we added this newly created `document` to the document `arraylist` created in the `savedDocument` method.

```java
    Document newDocument = fromDocumentEntity(savedDocument, userService.getUserById(savedDocument.getCreatedBy()), userService.getUserById(savedDocument.getUpdatedBy()));
        newDocuments.
add(newDocument);
```

### Document Resource

First we created a new class called `DocumentResources` this class is responsible for crated the endpoint for the
document.
We created a endpoint called `/upload` this endpoint has a method called the `saveDocuments` responsible for saving
newly
created document to the database. This method takes in the `authenticated_user`, `multipartFiles` documents and
`httpservletrequest` as param. Then it uses the saveDocument method from the `documentService` to save the document
passing in
the `userId` and the `documents`. After it then returns body of created passing in the request, map of new document and
a message.

```java

@PostMapping("/upload")
public ResponseEntity<Response> saveDocuments(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, @RequestParam("files") List<MultipartFile> documents, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var newDocuments = documentService.saveDocuments(user.getUserId(), documents);
    return ResponseEntity.created(URI.create("")).body(getResponse(request, Map.of("documents", newDocuments), "Document's uploaded", CREATED));
}
```

The next thing we have to do is, we need to be able to fetch all the document, now that we have define the `postmapping`
which
we use to create the document, we need a `getmapping` to get all the documentr we need.

### Document Resources (Fetching all the document)

First we define created a new endpoint with the methed getDocument, this endpoint is pointing to the "/documents" with
is the default entrypoint, this takes in @Authenticated User, HttpServlet Request and then a @RequestParam of page and
Size.
This is used to define the default value of page and size we want to get.

Then we request for the document using the getDocuments method in the user services, passing in the page and size.
After that we then return a ResponseEntity Ok and Body containing the request, document and a message.

```java

@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity<Response> getDocuments(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, HttpServletRequest request,
                                             @RequestParam(value = "page", defaultValue = "0") int page,
                                             @RequestParam(value = "size", defaultValue = "5") int size) {
    var documents = documentService.getDocuments(page, size);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("documents", documents), "Document's uploaded", OK);
}
```

Now we have a way both to created the document and also get the documents.

## Error Documentation for "/documents/upload"

When I tested the /document/upload endpoint, I received a 200 OK status, but the document was not actually uploaded, and
no response was returned. Checking the IDE console, I discovered a custom exception error: "Unable to upload document."

To investigate, I first added some System.out.print statements at key points in the code to trace the data flow and
confirm whether the expected logic was being executed. Since the console didn’t indicate where the issue originated, I
then used the debugging tool for more detailed insights. The debugger revealed a "credential not found" error, which
indicated that the application was attempting to retrieve user credentials but was failing.

This was puzzling because the credentials were successfully used when the user logged into the application. After
further debugging and researching the issue, I found that the application was trying to retrieve the credentials of a
non-authenticated user at a particular stage, despite an authenticated user being logged in.

The root cause was related to some pre-persist and post-persist methods I had initially created. These methods added a
userId to the request context, with the assumption that this userId would represent the createdBy user whenever an
entity was created. However, the userId persisted was hardcoded when the application was launched, meaning that even
when an authenticated user logged in, any entity created would still have the createdBy field set to the hardcoded
userId, rather than the authenticated user's ID.

To fix this, I removed the hardcoded values and updated the logic to ensure that the logged-in user's userId would be
used as the createdBy field. Now, whenever an entity is created, the createdBy field correctly reflects the
authenticated user rather than the static value.

Error with /document (Get)

2024-09-10T17:22:39.659+01:00 WARN 11440 --- [nio-8085-exec-5] .w.s.m.s.DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver :

project java.time.Instant to java.lang.String; Target type is not an interface and no matching Converter found]
```

Apperently the last login was a `String` instead of a `LocalDateTime`, thats why the application is having issue with
converting
the `localDateTime` to a `String` for the `LastLogin`.
The next thing we are going to work on now is the ability to search a document using the documentID ans searching the
doocument
by name and also update and download the document.

## Seach Document EndPoint

First we created a `search document` endpoint, it has a method named `seachDocuments` responsible for searching
documents,
this method takes the Authenticated User, HttpServlet Request and then RequestParm of page, size and name.
The page is the number of pages, Size is the number of data size and the name is the name of the document we want to
search.

```java

@GetMapping("/search")
public ResponseEntity<Response> searchDocuments(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, HttpServletRequest request,
                                                @RequestParam(value = "page", defaultValue = "0") int page,
                                                @RequestParam(value = "size", defaultValue = "5") int size,
                                                @RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "") String name) {
    var documents = documentService.getDocuments(page, size, name);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("documents", documents), "Document's Retrieved", OK));
}
```

The we initiate the getDocuments method, this method takes in page, size and name, similar to the previous getDocument,
the
only difference is that it retrived document based on the name param also. After than it then returns the documents
using
the findDocumentByName method in the documentRepository.

```java

@Override
public Page<IDocument> getDocuments(int page, int size, String name) {
    return documentRepository.findDocumentByName(name, PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("name")));
}
```

So the next thing we are going to do is created a way to find/search document by Id.

### Search document by documentId

First we created a getmapping endpoint called "/{documentId}", this endpoint has a method called the getDocument,
responsible
for getting/retriving only one document based on the id that belongs to the document.

The method takes in the @Authenticated User, @PathVarible documentId and an HttpServlet Request, then the method get the
document using the `getDocumentByDocumentId` method in the userServices, this method takes in `documentId`.
After we return an response Body ok, document objects and a message.

```java

@GetMapping("/{documentId}")
public ResponseEntity<Response> getDocument(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, @PathVariable("documentId") String documentId, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var document = documentService.getDocumentByDocumentId(documentId);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("document", document), "Document's Retrieved", OK));
}
```

The `getDocumentByDocumentId` method in the user servics takes in the `documentId`, then return an object of the
document based on the given id, if the document cannot be found it throws an Api Exception error "Document not found".

```java
  public IDocument getDocumentByDocumentId(String documentId) {
    return documentRepository.findDocumentByDocumentId(documentId).orElseThrow(() -> new ApiException("Document not found"));
}
```

So the next thing we are going to do now is make sure we can update the document.

### Update Document endpoint

> If we want to update anything in the database we need to fetch the the entity.
> Same goes for update anything in the file storage, we need to fetch it before we update it.

We created a patchMapping endpoint for updating the document, the endpoint has a method called `updateDocument`, takes
in
@Authenticated User, updateDocumentRequest which is a dto request and also HttpServletRequst.
Then the method calls the `updateDocument` method in the `userServices` this method takes in the document Id, name and
description.

```java

@PatchMapping
public ResponseEntity<Response> UpdateDocument(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, @RequestBody updateDocumentRequest document, HttpServletRequest request) {
    var updatedDocument = documentService.updateDocument(document.getDocumentId(), document.getName(), document.getDescription());
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(getResponse(request, Map.of("updatedDocument", updatedDocument), "Document's Updated", OK));
}
```

In this updateDocument(userServices), we getv the documentEntity, we need the document entity in other to update the
data
in the document, then we also get the document file storage path, if we want to update the document in the system
stortage
we need to also get path.
Then we rename the physical file in the file storage and also update the document name and description, finally we save
the documentEntity in the database and retuen the documentEntity so that the endpoint can then return it in the
responsebody
with a message " Document Updated".

```java

@Override
public IDocument updateDocument(String documentId, String name, String description) {
    try {
        var documentEntity = getDocumentEntity(documentId);
        var document = Paths.get(FILE_STORAGE).resolve(documentEntity.getName()).toAbsolutePath().normalize();
        Files.move(document, document.resolveSibling(name), REPLACE_EXISTING);
        documentEntity.setName(name);
        documentEntity.setDescription(description);
        documentRepository.save(documentEntity);
        return getDocumentByDocumentId(documentId);
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        throw new ApiException("Unable to update Document attributes");
    }
}
```

The next thing we are going to work on is make sure we can download the document.

#### Download Document

First we created a `/download/{documentName}` endpoint, this is responsible for allowing users to download documents
from
the application. The endpoint has a method called the `downloadDocument` this method takes in two param, the
@Authenticated
Users and @Pathvariable documentName, because the user need to provide the name of the document to be downloaded.
Then we get the resources(document), using the `userservices.getResources` method in the user servieces.
We created a new HttpHeader and then set the file name to the httpHeader the set the "Content-Disposition" header to
indicate
that the downloaded file should be treated as an attachment instead of inline and provide the filename in the header.

Then we set `content-type` header to the actual media type of the resource file, then we obtain the media type of the
file
using the Files.probeContentType.
Finally we create a ResponseEntity with the resource as the body, the content type set to the media type of the file,
and the headers set to the httpHeaders object

```java

@GetMapping("/download/{documentName}")
public ResponseEntity<Resource> downloadDocument(@AuthenticationPrincipal User user, @PathVariable("documentName") String documentName) throws IOException {
    var resource = documentService.getResource(documentName);
    var httpHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
    // Set the "File-Name" header to the documentName
    httpHeaders.add("File-Name", documentName);
    // Set the "Content-Disposition" header to indicate that the downloaded file should be treated as an attachment
    // and provide the filename in the header
    httpHeaders.add(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_DISPOSITION, String.format("attachment;File-Name=%s", resource.getFilename()));
        /* Set the "Content-Type" header to the media type of the resource file
        Obtain the media type of the file using Files.probeContentType()
        Create a ResponseEntity with the resource as the body, the content type set to the media type of the file,
        and the headers set to the httpHeaders object
         */
    return ResponseEntity.ok().contentType(MediaType.parseMediaType(Files.probeContentType(resource.getFile().toPath())))
        .headers(httpHeaders).body(resource);
}
```

The `getResouces` method from the endpoint helps to obtain the resources from the file storage, it takes in the `documentName
as param`, then we get the file_storage which is the path file. We then check if the file does not exist in the file
storage,
if the file exist we return the `urlResources` which is the `uri` of the filePath and if the file does not exist we
return
a new Api Exception with message "document not found".

```java

@Override
public Resource getResource(String documentName) {
    try {
        // Get the location of the file
        var filePath = Paths.get(FILE_STORAGE).toAbsolutePath().normalize().resolve(documentName);
        // Check if the file exist in the filepath
        if (!Files.exists(filePath)) {
            throw new ApiException("Document not found");
        }
        return new UrlResource(filePath.toUri());
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        throw new ApiException("Unable to update download document");
    }
}
```

So now the next thing we want to do is make sure that we set the access control for the endpoint, as of now all users
have
access to the endpoints but we only want specific users to have access to the endpoints, so we are going to set some
access control
for the application, thats what we will be working on next.
Using the `@preAuthorize` annotation, we where able to set the access based control for the users.

## Access Role Based

The `/register`, `/verify/qrcode` and the `/verify/account` endpoints are open endpoint, users dont need to be
authenticated before they can
access it and they dont need to be logged in before they can access it.

The current issue i am facing with this functionalities is that when ever a certain use doesnt have access to a certain
endpoint, it return a response entity of Ok, instead of a 403 `user has no permission`. I am thinking the isse is with
the requestUtil, because its handing the exception for any of the request.
However even it the 403 is handling the exception, the endpoint should retuernt the 200.ok so I need more time to figure
it
out and will probably get back to it in while.

For now we will continue with the next and last functionalites `Exception Handling`

# Exeception Handling(1)

First we created a new called called the `HandleException`, this class is responsible for handlling all the overall,
exception in the application. This called extends the `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` and implements `ErrorController`.
Then we inject the HttpServletRequest as a private field, we then override the `HandleExceptionInternal` method.
This method is called when an exception occurs in the process and is responsible for handling the exception and
returning
a response to the client.

This method takes in Exception, body, headers, httpStatusCode and WebRequest. Using the `@Slf4j` annotation it logs the
exception message and then called the helper method called the `handleErrorResponse` mto create an error object then
returns
the responsEntity object with error response and the statusCode.

```java
    private HttpServletRequest request;
@Override
protected ResponseEntity<Object> handleExceptionInternal(Exception exception, Object body, HttpHeaders headers, HttpStatusCode statusCode, WebRequest webRequest) {
    log.error(String.format("handleExceptionInternal: %s", exception.getMessage()));
    return new ResponseEntity<>(handleErrorResponse(exception.getMessage(), getRootCauseMessage(exception), request, statusCode), statusCode);
}
```

The `handleErrorResponse` method takes in a message, exception, httpServlet Request, HttpStatusCode, it then returns a
new
`Response` to the `HandleExceptionInternal` method.

```java
   public static Response handleErrorResponse(String message, String exception, HttpServletRequest request, HttpStatusCode status) {
    return new Response(now().toString(), status.value(), request.getRequestURI(), HttpStatus.valueOf(status.value()), message, exception, emptyMap());
}
```
